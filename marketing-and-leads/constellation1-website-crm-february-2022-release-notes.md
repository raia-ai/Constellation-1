## Constellation1 CRM 

Contact Search

We’ve made Contact Search more powerful. You can search the following fields:  
•    First Name  
•    Last Name  
•    Phone Number  
•    Email Address  
Previously, the phone number and email fields were searched using a “starts with” logic. We’ve updated the search logic, so it searches for “contains the following characters” for all four fields. 

For example, if you search for “Layla &,” the CRM will show “Layla & Robert” in the results.  

This new logic allows for even better, more robust results.

Contact Import

We’ve added Nickname as an option when importing contacts using our contact import file. When contacts are imported, their chosen nicknames will be displayed in their contact records.

The sample contact import file linked on the Import Contacts page has been updated to reflect this change. You can also use the linked sample file as a template to import your contacts.

Contact Address Details

We’ve updated the address fields in the Contact Details section of a contact record. The updated layout simplifies how the address fields are displayed and improves usability.

Contact Groups

We’ve improved the usability of the contact groups page. Currently, you can search for contacts within a group and select the number of results shown on the page.

With this enhancement, we’ve added Search and Show options to the “Action Plans” and “Calendar Events” sections. This supports the ability to search and sort contacts, action plans, and calendar items quickly and easily.

Action Plans

As a maintenance task, we’re removing outdated Homeowners Newsletters and seasonal action plans. Newsletters and seasonal event campaigns dated 2021 and earlier will be removed from Action Plan Manager.

Share Jump Searches

We’ve added the ability for agents, offices, and company administrators to easily share custom jump searches to their social media pages. 

On your Jump Searches administration page, you will notice a new “Share” button. Clicking this button will show the options to share the jump search to the following platforms:  
•    Pinterest  
•    LinkedIn  
•    Twitter  
•    Facebook  
•    Email

Selecting the option to share with a specific social media platform will open a posting workflow for that platform. 

Sharing jump searches is a great way to present listings to your followers or send emails to your leads. Jump search results are branded to you and will show listings on your branded website. 

## Bug Fixes  

#### CRM 

**Action Plans:** We’ve updated the Happy Birthday and Happy Home Anniversary action plans to include a space between the senders first and last name.  

#### Website  

**Securing Custom Website Domains:** We fixed an issue with setting a security certificate for the www record for a custom domain.
