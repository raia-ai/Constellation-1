# How to Create a Facebook Business Page

To successfully connect with our Nestfully Social product, you'll need to create a Facebook Business Page. This will allow you to receive the perks that Nestfully Social provides, including all automated posts.

**NOTE: This is a little easier to do on a computer versus mobile, as there are fewer steps involved. We recommend doing this from your computer's browser.**

Before you begin, you'll need to make sure you're logged into your Facebook account. Once logged in, navigate to the top right, where your profile picture is displayed. Click **Page** in the drop-down menu.

You'll see a blank template of a page that looks like this:

On the left of the page, you'll see three things you need to enter in: **Page Name, Category,** and **Bio**. The first two are required; the third is optional. We do recommend filling out a short one-sentence bio that lets people know you're a real estate agent, though.

After entering in your key info above, you'll be directed to Step 1 of 5: **Finish setting up your Page**. You've created your page; now it's time to fill in info such as **Phone Number, Email, Address, City/town,** and **ZIP code.** You also have the option to share business hours if you have hours you like to work within.

Next, you'll **Customize your Page** by adding a profile picture and a cover photo. The profile picture should be a professional one of you or your business logo.

**NOTE:** Step 3 of 5 is about connecting the app WhatsApp to your page. For US readers, skip this step.

From there, you can invite friends to like your page, turn on notifications about your page, and turn on automated emails from Meta (Facebook's parent company) that give you tips and tricks on how to better promote your page.

Once you've finished the five steps, you'll receive a notification that lets you know your page is created.
