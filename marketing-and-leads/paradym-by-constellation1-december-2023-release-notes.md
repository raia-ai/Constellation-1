Bug Fixes 

1\. We fixed an issue with preview videos failing to be posted to Instagram.  
Previously, when preview videos were automatically posted to Instagram, they would fail due to Instagram changing validation for videos to Reels in their API.   
Now, this issue has been resolved. 

2\. We fixed an issue with users not being able to edit leads generated from My Tours.  
Previously, Paradym users were not able to edit and save updates to leads generated from My Tours.   
Now, this issue has been resolved.
