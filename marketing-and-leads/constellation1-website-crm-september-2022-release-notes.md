## CONSTELLATION1 CRM 

Sending Emails from Groups

We’ve improved email sending from groups. When sending emails to contacts in a group, the user has the option to select one or more group members. 

When the user selects one or more contacts in a group and clicks the Send Email button, the email modal will default to Email Selected Contacts. 

If there are no contacts selected, the modal will default to Email All Contacts.

If the user chooses Email Selected Contacts and no contacts are selected, the user will receive an error message:

Recommended Property Emails

We recently released Recommended Property Emails. We’ve added a new configuration to send emails only to contacts who are assigned to an agent.

When this feature is enabled, Recommended Property Emails will now only be sent to contacts who are assigned to an agent. Emails will not be sent to contacts who are only assigned to an office or the company. 

There are no changes to the branding of the emails. They will continue to be branded to the assigned agent and include their contact information. 

For our agent channel customers, support for individualized brokerage logo branding will be available in the future.

For more details, contact your Constellation1 representative. 

User Interface Updates

**Preferred Contact Method**  
For a better, more consistent user experience, we’ve updated the preferred contact method when adding a new contact to CRM to match the options shown on the contact detail page. This update applies to both the CRM mobile and desktop applications.

**Adding Event Activities**

We’ve added a character counter to the Subject field when adding an event. There is a 40-character limit. The counter will display the number of characters that have been typed.

**To Dos**

When creating a To Do, users can now create their own subject line.

Previously, users would select a Task from a pre-defined dropdown list. We’ve replaced the dropdown list with a text field where the user can add a subject that is up to 40 characters long. This improvement helps the user see at a glance more details regarding the To Do.

**Groups**

Now it’s easier to manage contacts in the Groups module. We’ve added Contact’s Last Action and My Next Activity columns to the Groups page. This update makes it easier for the agent to see their next activity for any given contact.

**Acton Plan Manager**

We’ve moved the action buttons to the top of the preview modal when previewing Action Plan emails. This update places the Print and Close options at the top of the preview window for easy access.

Coming Soon 

Email deliverability is an important pillar of any digital marketing strategy and maintaining contact with your leads. We’re pleased to announce we will soon be upgrading emails sent from CRM to MailGun. 

MailGun provides a high level of service and accountability, ensuring a high sender score and a high rate of delivered emails from a secure and stable environment.  

The MailGun rollout will be a phased. Beginning with selected stakeholders, we will upgrade their email service to MailGun. We will then work with each customer individually to upgrade their email service. The phased rollout will ensure there are no gaps or issues with the upgrade and email service continues without interruption.  

A Constellation1 representative will contact each company to schedule the upgrade. 

## CRM MOBILE APP

User Interface Updates

We’ve made improvements to the CRM mobile app user interface. The improvements provide a consistent user experience between the CRM mobile app and the desktop CRM. 

For example, the preferred contact method will now be the same when adding a contact to the CRM mobile app and the desktop CRM. 

## CONSTELLATION1 WEBSITES

Architecture  

We’ve updated the overall architecture of our websites for improved performance, including faster page loading speeds for a better user experience across devices. This update also improves SEO, making it easier and faster for search engines to catalog your website and improve your score. 

The CSS has been optimized on the following pages:  
•    Listing Landing   
•    Community Landing   
•    Public Record Landing   
•    Listing Detail

Social Media Login

Recently, we updated the workflow for creating and logging into accounts on Constellation1 websites for consumers who use social media. In this release we have updated the social media icons and logos to meet the branding guidelines provided by each of the social media partners.

## BUG FIXES

**CRM** 

1\. Fixed an issue with Quick Emails not removing groups that had been deleted from the To field. 

Previously, when a group had been selected in the To field, then removed by the user, the group would remain in the To field of the Quick Email and members of that group would receive the email. 

Now, when a user removes a group from the To field, the group will be removed, and the email will not be sent to anyone who is not included in the To field. 

2\. Fixed an issue with adding a contact that has previously been deleted. 

Previously, when a contact was added and then deleted, the agent was not able to add them again. 

Now, an agent can add and register a contact to CRM even after previously deleting them. 

**Mobile CRM App**  
   
1\. Fixed an issue with Saved Properties not showing the No Photo placeholder. 

Previously, when a property that did not have a listing photo was saved, it would show a blank space where the photo should display. 

Now, when a property that does not have a photo is saved, a No Photo placeholder image will show. 

  
**Website**

1\. Fixed an issue with rotating title tags not saving when this feature is enabled. 

Previously, when rotating title tags were turned on, the selection was not being saved. 

Now, after turning on rotating title tags, this selection is saved and this feature is enabled. 

2\. Fixed an issue with the Property Editor not saving changes when MLS Area was not selected. 

Previously, when updating a listing in the Property Editor, the changes would not save if the MLS Area was not selected. 

Now, we have removed the requirement to select an MLS Area when saving changes to a listing. 

3\. Fixed an issue with some commercial listings that were For Rent/Lease being labeled For Sale. 

Previously, in some cases, a commercial property that was For Rent/Lease would show as For Sale with an incorrect price. 

Now, commercial listings that are For Rent/Lease will show as For Rent/Lease with the correct price.
