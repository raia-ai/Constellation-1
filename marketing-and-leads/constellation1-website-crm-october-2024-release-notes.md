Users can scroll through the list of properties and click on any one to view its full listing details.

Inactive Agents

We’ve added a 301 redirect to agent profile landing pages when their account is set to inactive or deleted. \
If a consumer has saved the URL of an agent’s landing page that is no longer available, when attempting to accessing the page, they will be presented with a friendly message informing them of the status. Clicking OK in the message will redirected the user to the agent search page.

A 301 redirect improves a website's SEO by clearly signaling to search engines that the requested URL has been permanently moved to a new location.&#x20;

Open House Video and Photos (OVP Page)

We’ve updated the OVP page to include the following information, “Changes made in Property Editor will be over-written by the MLS data except for Pocket Listings (Internal Listings)”.

Pocket listings will continue to be fully editable, however, MLS sourced listing images will be obtained exclusively from the Multiple Listing Service (MLS).&#x20;

Customer Email Unsubscribe Page\
The customer unsubscribe page now includes more detailed information about the specific emails users are opting out of. \
Under “You are about to unsubscribe from the following notifications for your account:” we've added the following text: "All marketing emails from \[Company Name]".\
If the customer is associated with an agent, they will be unsubscribed from all emails sent by the company and that agent.

## Bug Fixes

**Website**

1\. Fixed an issue with office listings displaying as a featured property on agent websites who are not members of the MLS.

Previously, in some cases listings were showing as featured properties on agent websites when the agent was not a member of the MLS board of the listing.&#x20;

Now, this issue has been resolved, agents must be a member of the MLS to display those listings on their website.
