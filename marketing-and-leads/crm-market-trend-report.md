# CRM - Market Trend Report

The Market Trend Report is a new optional feature for companies that have both rDesk Website and rDesk CRM and wish to expand lead capture and conversion by offering consumers valuable market data based on their selected location(s).

Consumers visiting your website can view Market Trends based on an address and/or city and zip code that they have entered on the page. After viewing the Market Trends, they will have the option to complete and submit a form that will sign them up to receive a similar report via email (using our Action Plan Manager) report every 30, 60, and/or 90 days with updated market trend information for that same location.

Agents and Customer Care admins can also sign-up their existing contacts and leads for this same report within CRM from the contact record.

The current implementation assumes the company/franchise receives all off market data through all their MLS feeds compliant with MLS rules.

**FAQs**

What data displays on the Market Trends webpage and in the Market Trend Action Plan email?

It is a mix of active and sold or “off market” data displayed in a series of charts and widgets that includes the following,

*   Median List Price
*   Days on Market
*   Inventory (Properties for Sale)
*   Median Sales Price (Median Sold Price)
*   Homes Sold – Units
*   Median Price per Square Feet
*   Average List/Sales Price (List Price vs. Sold Price)
*   Comparable Sales to include Current and Sold (Recent Nearby Properties for Sale/Sold)

If we do not have enough data to calculate medians, a message will display that “not enough information is available to display the data at this time” on the webpage. In addition, the Action Plan will not be sent.

Can you give me more information on how this data is being “rolled up”?

*   The data is being rolled up monthly for city and/or zip code data points by Company/RECoID (goes with Website)
*   Also, for any single given city data, there are up to “16” MLS listing sources in combination for a given company. These MLS listing source combinations are unique to each company
*   Until a Company is enabled, there are no data points available for the specific company as there is no way to guess the combination of MLS listing sources that will be used for a new company.

How is this different from My Neighborhood Report/CMA?

The Market Trend Report is a “canned” report with the intention of providing useful market area content while capturing new leads and continued engagement with existing leads and contacts.

In comparison, the My Neighborhood Report/CMA allows agents and admins to customize and target specific locations to each market with the intent of gaining a listing.

What are the costs for this feature?

None! Companies who will need to add VOW\*, to be able to display and distribute the necessary MLS data for the charts and graphs that display for both the Market Trends page and the Market Trend Action Plan, will incur a cost associated with setting up VOW data feeds and VOW monthly fees.

In addition, professional services may be needed for customer-specific requirements changes for both the Market Trend website page and/or the Market Trend Action Plans.

How does a customer request this feature?

By contacting their Account Manager who can assist with identifying the data requirements for each MLS their market covers ensuring displaying and distributing off market data is in compliance.
