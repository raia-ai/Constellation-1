# How to Create an Instagram Business Page

To connect with our Nestfully Social product via Instagram, you need a business page, not a personal page. We also recommend having a business page in general, as it allows you to separate the professional from the personal.

**Step 1:** Go to instagram.com and click the Sign Up button.

**Step 2:** Like you would for most sites, enter in your email, your full name, a username, and a password. Once this is submitted, Instagram will send a verification code to your email. This works the same whether registering for the site through the iPhone/Android app or your browser.

**Step 3:** Once you receive your verification code, log into the account. Your first action will be the look to the bottom of the left-hand navigation bar (bottom-right profile icon, then top right of the screen on the phone app) on your browser.

**Step 4:** Scroll down on the navigation bar to where it says **Account type and tools**, then click there.

**Step 6:** Select Business. From there, you can select whatever you'd like for your profession, but for obvious reasons we recommend Real Estate Agent (or similar).

**Hit Done on both, then you're fully good to go!** It's that simple. Now, you've got an Instagram business page you can use to connect with our Nestfully Social product.
