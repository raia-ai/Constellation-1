## Constellation1 Website

**RECOMMENDED PROPERTIES**

Meaningful contact with your leads and clients is highly valuable. Recommended properties emails branded to your company or individual agent will provide a valuable source of compelling information and a touch point to keep clients engaged with you and your website.

Recommended properties emails are based on the most recent saved property.

Once a client creates an account and saves a property, they will automatically be opted in and will begin receiving recommended properties emails.

Recommended properties are based on,  
•    Similar property types.  
•    Pre-determined radius from the saved property.  
•    Price range 10% higher or lower than the saved price.  
•    Plus or minus 1 Bedroom.  
•    Plus or minus 1Bathroom.

Recommended properties emails will show a maximum of 10 properties and will be sent every Monday. Broker-owned listings are displayed first to encourage double-sided deals. Then properties are sorted by the most recent listing date.
