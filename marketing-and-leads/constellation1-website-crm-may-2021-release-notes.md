## CONSTELLATION1 CRM WITH MOBILE APP

**CRM DASHBOARD**&#x20;

Constellation1 has updated the CRM dashboard and widgets with a new look and feel. We have also created a new Lead Activity widget.&#x20;

The new look and feel features an organized layout that is four columns wide, providing a larger workspace for enhanced usability. Widgets have been lined up in rows for improved readability. The left navigation is collapsed by default.&#x20;

The updated widgets have a clean and easy to use interface. Updates include removing pagination. In cases where information carried over to another page, we have added a “View More” link.

_Examples of updated widgets_

The new Lead Activity widget is designed to show the total number of leads that have interacted with your website in the last 30 days.&#x20;

The circle graphs display the top 4 sources with the most interactions.&#x20;

Interactions include but are not limited to: \
•    form submissions\
•    saving searches\
•    properties&#x20;

The widget shows activity for existing leads and new leads.

We are reaching out to companies individually to coordinate the roll-out of the new dashboard.\
Once the new dashboard has been enabled, agents will have the option to “Revert to Current Design.” Selecting this option will override the updated dashboard. This will allow agents to adjust to the new look and feel. The revert option will be available for a limited time after implementation of the new dashboard. Then, all agents will be upgraded to the new dashboard.
