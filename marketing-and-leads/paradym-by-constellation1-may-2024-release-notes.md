## Release Details

Tour Code Branding Options  
We have updated the branding options to either display or not display branding in text messages that are sent to consumers when they text a tour code.   
When creating a Property Tour, the user has the option to apply branding to the tour.

 When the tour is not branded, the consumer will receive an unbranded text message in response to their inquiry. 

Updated Click to Chat Transcripts 

We’ve updated the Click to Chat transcripts that are emailed to agents when a chat session has ended or if the agent is unavailable. We now include the lead and property information in the emailed transcripts.  
This helps the agent know who is inquiring about a property.
