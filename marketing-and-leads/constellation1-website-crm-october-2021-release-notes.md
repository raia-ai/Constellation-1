## Constellation1 CRM

Contact Groups

We’re always listening and welcome your feedback. At your request, we have improved the usability of the groups module. When viewing leads and clients in a group, you can now click on their name to go to the contact’s details page, making navigation much easier.

**_Pro Tip:_** _Right click on the contact’s name to open their detail page in a new tab or window. This will allow you to work on your lead, then get back to the group quickly and easily._  

Lead History Verbiage  

We have updated the message shown in the lead history to be friendlier and more descriptive.

Previously, when an agent declined a lead using the mobile CRM app, the message shown on the history tab of the client record said, “Lead Declined by Contact API”.

We have updated this messaging to now read as:

*   Lead was declined by assignee via CRM Mobile App.
*   Lead was declined by assignee via CRM Website.

Improved Left Navigation

We have improved the functionality of the left navigation menu. By default, the left navigation menu is collapsed. You have the option to expand it by clicking the arrow at the bottom.

For a consistent user experience, the left navigation menu will remember your selection and display consistently as collapsed or expanded as you navigate around the CRM.''
