# Enabling HTML editing mode when composing emails/creating email templates

The following steps will show you how to enable HTML editing when creating email templates or when composing an email to send out to contacts.

  
Composing an email:

1\. Hover over Email and click Compose Mass Email.

Creating an Email template:

1\. Hover over Marketing and click Template Library.  
2\. Click Email Library.  
3\. Choose the category in the top right where you want the email template to be saved.  
4\. Click Create New Template in the lower left.

  
Either of these steps will bring up the following editing screen. What appears above this section is different depending on which set of steps you went through, however enabling HTML editing is the same for both.

Click the gear icon located in the top right corner and click Edit HTML Source. Once in the edit mode, you can paste/add in your HTML Content.

Note that it would be up to the customer to provide the HTML code and/or edit that code when creating the email. Our Customer Care department will not provide assistance with creating HTML code or troubleshooting any formatting issues that may occur.
