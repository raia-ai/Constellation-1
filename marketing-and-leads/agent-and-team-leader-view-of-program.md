# Agent and Team Leader View of Program

Constellation1 Commissions provides the ability for agents to sign into the program to view their own specific activity as an agent or team leader if applicable.

**Note:** On Agent Landing page, it is possible to filter your agents by Office or status of Active/Inactive/All.  When there are no filters set the filter button will display in black.  When there is a filter engaged, the filter button will display in Blue.

The system will then display a confirmation asking if you wish to send the invite, and then select Invite.  An invitation will then be sent via email to the agent using the email attached to their agent profile with sign in credentials for them to access the program.

**Agent View**

By default, agents will only be able to see any Listings, Transactions, and Contacts they are associated with.&#x20;

For instance if an agent is sharing a side of a transaction with another agent, they will only be able to see THEIR portion of the transaction.

When signed into the program and the team leader view is selected from the drop down as mentioned above, that agent will be able to view any activity their Team is assigned to.

When agents sign into the program, they will be shown a customized version of the program similar to below:

If "Can Add/Edit" is toggled **OFF**, agents/team leaders will not be able to enter or edit ANY details on a transaction or any new transaction.

Once these changes are made they are effective immediately.
