**1\. What is tour strength and where to view your tour strength.**

**Tour strength is a way to loosely measure the reach your visual tour could have.  You can view your Tour Strength from the tour that you wish to strengthen.  Once you are logged into Paradym, click on the agent's name in the top right corner and click on My Tours.  From here, you will click on the visual tour for the property that you wish to strengthen.  Once you are on the tour dashboard for that specific property, you will look for this:**

**When you see this, click on the words "Improve My Score".  This will take you to the page where you can view the various suggestions.  In this article, I will go through each section briefly.  Each section will have either a red x or a green check mark next to the item.  If the item has a red x, it means that you can improve your score by completing this item.  If the item has a green check mark, the item is already completed and counting towards your score.  To complete an item, you can click on words next to the red x and the system will take you out of the checklist so you can complete that item.**

**Keep in mind, Tour Strength is simply suggestions on ways you can improve your reach and not required items.  These are completely optional and up to your discretion.** 

**2\. Photos.**

**There are three items listed in Photos.**

**This section can vary based on your properties.  Some may not need as many photos but the first two will change to the green check mark if you do have the appropriate number of photos or more.  The last one, At Least 1 Panoramic Photo, is based on whether you use the Paradym system to stitch photos together to create a panoramic photo.  If you use your phone or a camera to take the photo in panoramic mode, it will not mark this with a check mark.**  

**3\. Tour Details**

**There are four items in Tour Details.**

**In order to "Complete Tour Description", click on Details under the Property Tour section.**

**From here, you will input your tour description in the area labeled Description and click the Save button when finished.**

**The second and third options under Tour Details can be found in the same place.  Next to each photo you will have five links.  To ensure that "Every Scene Has A Caption" and "Every Scene Has A Description", you will click on the Details link next to each photo.**

**This will bring you to a page where you can edit both your Caption (red arrow) and Description (purple arrow).  It may automatically apply the file name as the caption but you can change that here as well.  Once you add in the information that you would like into the Caption and Description fields, be sure to hit the Save button in the top right corner.  To receive the check mark for these options, every photo would need to have the caption or description.**

**The last option under Tour Details is the Open House.  If you have an open house scheduled, you can add it to your visual tour under the main Details link.**

**Social Presence refers to whether the visual tour has been posted on social media sites.  This can be a connected automatic postings or manual postings using the Share buttons on the tours.  You can find the Share buttons in the Marketing section of the Tour Dashboard.**

**Once the property has been shared out to the corresponding social media platform, it will place a check mark beside that platform in your Tour Strength.  If it shows a red x, you can go to your Share buttons and share it out.  Also recommended that you connect the social media connection so we can continue sharing it out on a regular basis for you.**

**5\. Distribution**
