# How to Create a Twitter/X Account

If you'd like to connect your Twitter/X profile to Nestfully Social, the steps are pretty easy to follow and can be found [here](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/knowledgeBase/23405260). This article is for **creating** a Twitter/X account.

To start, you'll head to twitter.com or x.com. As of 2024, both of these work. Click the button that says **Create account:**

From there, you'll enter in your name and one of two things: an email address or a phone number. Which one you use is ultimately your choice, but you can toggle between the two options by clicking **Use phone instead** or **Use email instead**. You'll also fill out your date of birth to ensure you're of age for an account.

From there, Twitter/X will send a verification code to the email or phone number you signed up with. You'll fill that code in here and click **Next:**

And your account is created! From there, you can edit your profile picture, cover photo, bio, and much more, but this covers the basics of getting an account on Twitter/X created for use for Nestfully Social.
