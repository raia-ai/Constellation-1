## WEBSITE

**Public Records  
**

Public records are an important part of listing data for your customers and to improve SEO. Constellation1 has updated the system to improve how we are linking to public records pages. The update will improve SEO and provide better information to your customers.   

When users search for properties, we will link to the MLS listing details page if the property has one available.   
Example: [https://www.longandfoster.com/homes-for-sale/19-Parkside-Drive-Hummelstown-PA-17036-220148306](https://www.longandfoster.com/homes-for-sale/19-Parkside-Drive-Hummelstown-PA-17036-220148306) 

When an MLS listing detail page is not available, we will link to the public records page.   
Example: [https://www.longandfoster.com/realestate/19-parkside-dr-hummelstown-pa-17036-179513028?hv=1](https://www.longandfoster.com/realestate/19-parkside-dr-hummelstown-pa-17036-179513028?hv=1)   
   
We also updated the ‘/realestate/’ landing pages to include 301 redirects to properties that do not have an MLS property details page.   
Example: [https://www.longandfoster.com/realestate/PA/Hummelstown](https://www.longandfoster.com/realestate/PA/Hummelstown) 

Properties on the page immediately above will all link to the public records page for each property.

Why did we do this? Linking to the best information available is always a good thing. This update also improves the 301 redirects, which increases SEO effectiveness of the public records pages and data. 

Configurations: This update has been made for everyone.  

  
**Market Trend Report**  

The Market Trend report has proven to be a valuable resource, providing quality market information to your customers. 

For a more accurate and robust report, we collect and roll up MLS listing data over time. The longer we’ve been able to collect data, the better the report will be. 

In some cases, there may be some areas where we need to roll up more data. The messaging for specific metrics could show “Unknown”.

To provide better messaging, we have updated the “Unknown” message to say:  
   
"Sorry, our system is still accumulating data to provide an accurate report. To get immediate access to the latest market trend insights, please reach out to our office and an expert will assist with your needs"  
   
Why did we do this? Improved messaging for a better user experience and to turn this into a lead generation opportunity. 

Configurations: This update has been made for all companies who are using the Market Trend report. If you would like more information about adding the Market Trend report to your website, please reach out to your account manager. 

  
**Accessibility Improvements**  
We continue to make updates to our website products so that they can meet accessibility guidance provided by the ADA. To that extent, we have been working behind the scenes running accessibility scans and making updates as highlighted by the scan engines. 

  
The most common types of findings are related to HTML tags & labels, for example, a missing ALT tag or label. As we make these changes, we review the impact on the website. Once proven to be effective, we will push the changes out to websites in the production environment. 

  
Examples of updates include:   
•    Added ALT tags where they were missing on various HTML elements.   
•    Improved ALT text on various HTML elements.   
•    Standardized ID naming on HTML elements.   
•    Improved “ARIA Label” tagging. 

Why did we do this? To continue to strive to meet accessibility guidance to allow individuals with disabilities easier access and improved usability of your website. 

  
Configuration: This review and subsequent updates have been made to user templates for all companies.
