# How to Create a LinkedIn Business Page

To successfully connect with our Nestfully Social product, you'll need to create a LinkedIn Business Page. This will allow you to receive the perks that Nestfully Social provides, including all automated posts.

To start, go to linkedin.com and click **Join Now**.

From here, you'll enter in your preferred email and password of choice.

After clicking **Agree & Join** and entering your first and last name, you'll be directed to a **Security verification** image like the one below.

Once this is done, you'll enter in your **Country/Region, Postal code,** and **Location**. Here's an example:

From there, you'll be directed to a screen that asks for your most recent job title. Obviously, you want to fill in your current role, which is Real Estate Agent. Fill that in, click the correct employment type (Full-time or Part-time), and list the name of your associated company as well.

After this, you'll be sent an authorization code to the email address you signed up with. **Please have your email account pulled up when you are registering for this LinkedIn business page.** The authorization page will look like this.

Once the code arrives in your inbox, type it into that text box and hit **Agree & Confirm**. 

Next, you'll be asked **Are you looking for a job?** Assuming you're not, click **No, I'm not interested in any job opportunity**.

![](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/api/attachments/action/1/baf06f2e-36c1-4e63-ba15-235a332312cb)

From there, you can add connections you may know, but for brevity, we'll skip that part. You'll next be prompted to upload a profile photo, preferably a professional one, that helps visitors to your page recognize you.

There! Now your LinkedIn Business Page is set up, and you can begin filling out the relevant sections of your profile instantly.
