# Teams For Company Admins | Constellation1 Customer Hub

**rW Website – Team Administration**

Team websites have been improved. The improved functionality will allow agents who are members of a team, the ability to have multiple websites, such as a team website and an individual website. This feature is optional and will need to be enabled at the company website level. The workflow for teams and agents with a single website has not changed.

Only an admin has the ability to create teams and delete teams. This guide will step you through managing teams and teams with multiple websites.

## **Notes for Company Administrators**

With the implementation of new functionality and improved workflow, the notes below will provide a deeper understanding regarding the update.

* The team creation process will follow the familiar workflow of using the primary team member’s website to create the team website. If the primary team member also requires a personal website, you will need to add the additional website to their account after the team has been created. To activate another website for the agent, navigate to the agent’s User Summary page, click the ‘Activate New Website’ button.
* The ability to add additional websites to an agent account or preserve a team members website when added to a team, is dependent on this feature being enabled for your company. This should be discussed during the implementation phase of building the company website, or if not already available, can be enabled for existing websites via a request to the company’s Account Manager.
* Agent/Users with multiple websites will be updated to the new workflow. i.e. The ‘My Websites’ page will be available in the top banner, to the agent who has multiple websites.\
  &#x20;
* Existing teams that use a “dummy” account as the primary team site, will not be impacted if the team members have only one website, the team website.
* Existing teams that use a “dummy” account as the team site and, where agents have retained an individual site in addition to the team website, the dummy account will have access to the ‘My Websites’ page in their admin account. The team admin who is able to logon with the dummy account will be able to designate a team member as the administrator.
* As a company administrator, you will not be able to view the ‘My Websites’ link that shows for the agent in the top banner. To view the ‘My Websites’ page, you will need to login as the agent. &#x20;
* The ‘My Websites’ link will only show in the top banner area of an agent account only if that agent has two or more websites associated to their account. &#x20;
* Websites associated to a user can be found on the User Summary Info page, under Websites.
* As a company admin, you have access to view the agent websites from the User Summary Info page. You can also set the primary website for the agent. &#x20;
* When logged in as the company admin, and viewing the agent’s admin, User Summary Info page, the agent’s ‘primary’ website is editable from the left nav. To edit the secondary website, you will need to make it the primary. After editing, you can make the other site the primary again.
* If the status of the primary agent’s account changes to Inactive, the team website will also be set to inactive and not show on the public facing website.
* In the team creation process you have the option to retain or delete the team members current website. See step 9 above. Deleting the website in this step will pass all leads and current website URL’s to the primary team members website, the team website.
* The primary team member has the ability to assign admin rights to any and all team members.
* Each team member who has a team website and a personal website, will be able to designate one or the other website as their primary website. This means the ‘View My Website’ link on the agent profile page in the agent search, will link to the designated primary website.
* The new team functionality is currently not configured to work with office websites.
* If some website features are not showing for a website that was added to an agent account, check the website package setting for that website.
