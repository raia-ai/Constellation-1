## Release Details 

Multi Photo Social Postings  
We’ve updated how multi-photo posts are handled on Facebook and LinkedIn. If a post's description text exceeds 79 characters, an ellipsis (...) is appended to the text indicating that additional text is available. Users can click the ellipsis to view the full description.

  
Coming Soon! Enhanced Office Accounts  
We’re developing comprehensive office-level accounts to better serve brokers and agents.   
These accounts will include automated features for social media posting and property tour creation - capabilities you're already familiar with on the individual broker and agent accounts.   
This will empower offices to easily promote themselves, their listings, and their agents.  
More details on these new features will be available in upcoming releases.

  
Bug Fixes   
1\. We fixed an issue brokers getting an error message when adding agents to the Paradym system.   
Previously, when a broker added an agent to Paradym and selected the agent’s office , they would receive an error message.   
Now, this issue has been resolved. 

Technology Updates  
1\. We’ve upgraded our .Net framework to .Net8.0 and Framework to .Net4.8. Previously we were on .Net6.0 and .Net framework 4.7.2.
