* The first allows them to unsubscribe from only this Action Plan.
* The second allows them to unsubscribe from all Action Plans from the sender.
* The third allows them to unsubscribe from all Action Plans for the company.

When the contact unsubscribes, the option chosen is logged on the History tab for the contact as well as in the Last Action hover text. The descriptions for each are as follows:

* Contact unsubscribed from Email Activities sent from {CompanyName} OR
* Contact unsubscribed from Email Activities sent from Agent {AgentName} OR
* Contact unsubscribed from Email Activities that are part of APM Plan {PlanName}
