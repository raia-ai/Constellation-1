Custom Branding

We are pleased to announce custom branding (white labeling) is now available for broker level accounts. 

This allows new broker level Paradym account implementations to be customized with the broker branding. 

Custom branding includes,

•    Your company logo and color scheme on the user interface.  
•    Unique URL branded to your company.   
•    Outgoing emails branded to your company. 

Please contact your Constellation1 representative for more details. 

Custom Disclaimer  
We’ve increased the maximum character limit for the Property Details disclaimer from 750 to 1,250 characters to meet requirements set by the MLS’s.

Auto-Create Agent Accounts   
We’ve updated the automatic agent account creation feature to only generate accounts for agents with active listings. This change prevents the system from creating unnecessary agent accounts.

User Interface Updates    
We have updated the Twitter logo to X to reflect the new branding.

Bug Fixes 

1\. We fixed an issue with email notification not being sent when the blog calendar has been updated. 

Previously, the email notifications that informed agents of blog calendar updates were not being sent.

Now, this issue has been resolved. 

2\. We fixed an issue with errors in the change password verification code emails being sent to brokers. 

Previously, when a broker clicked Forgot Password to reset their top-level password, the verification email contained errors preventing the broker from changing their password. 

Now, this issue has been resolved. 

3\. We fixed an issue with the scroll bars not showing on property tours when a custom skin is applied. 

Previously, when an agent changed the skin of their property tours, the scroll bars didn’t show, preventing the consumer from scrolling the property tour page. 

Now, this issue has been resolved. 

4\. We fixed an issue with blogs not being posted when a new agent signed up.

Previously, when a new agent subscribed to blog posting, an article was supposed to be posted on the day of subscription. However, this same-day posting feature was not functioning as intended.

Now, this issue has been resolved.
