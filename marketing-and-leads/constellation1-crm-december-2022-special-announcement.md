## Constellation1 CRM Special Announcement!

**Action Plan Manager:** The new 2023 Action Plans are here!  

## DETAILS

NEW! 2023 Action Plans    
The new 2023 action plans are now available in the CRM.    
We’ve updated the system-level action plans with new messages and send dates to match the 2023 calendar. 

The updated plans for 2023 include,   
•    Annual Occasions   
•    Home Owners Newsletter Series   
•    Fall Back/Spring Forward

If you’re using the system-level action plans, there is no other action needed. The action plans will continue to be sent to your recipients.  

If you are using a customized version of these plans, the plan will finish when the last message is sent.   
You can choose to copy the recipients from your custom plan into the new system plan, or you can customize the new system plan, then copy the recipients from your previous custom plan and add them to your new action plan. 

Copy Recipients 

Users can easily copy the recipients assigned to one Action Plan and add them to another Action Plan. 

The steps to copy recipients from an action plan are,  
1\.    Open the new action plan, scroll to the bottom of the page, and click “Manage Recipients”.  
2\.    Click Add Recipients and a pop-up window will open.   
3\.    In the Filter By dropdown, select the action plan that has the contacts to be assigned to the new action plan.  
4\.    Select the contacts you wish to add to the new 2023 plan using the check check boxes then click Save.
