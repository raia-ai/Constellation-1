# The Benefits to Paradym's Single Property Site Viewer

The below article reviews the benefits to Paradym’s Single Property Site Viewer.

Brief Description:

Most real estate pros have seen and/or are using a traditional virtual tour template to showcase an active listing they have on the market. Paradym’s more traditional tour viewer is our Fusion viewer. However, agents have another optional viewer to use, the Single Property Site. The Property Site takes on a totally different viewing experience. 

Steps Outline Below:

Step 1: Fusion viewer vs. Single Property Site in appearance

Step 2: The Benefits to our Single Property Site

Step 1: Fusion viewer vs. Single Property Site in appearance

The Fusion viewer is a more traditional virtual tour option.  This viewer features a 'click and play' option to view, listen, and watch a virtual tour going through a professional slideshow of the listing photos. It will also include any details of the property in the slideshow as you listen to background music and our featured customizable voiceover options.  You will notice tabs to the left that include further property details and information, and you will notice the agent and company branding information located on the right side of the tour.

The Single Property Site takes on a completely different viewing experience. The Property Site looks and is treated like a website for your listing as you can literally scroll up and down on the page to read and review the details, photos, mapping, etc. of the listing property. It can be perceived to have a more modern twist to it. Many real estate pros will preference one viewer over the other, but the Property Site will definitely have its’ own benefits. See below several image views, 4 screenshots as you scroll top to bottom on the Property Site viewer 'template.'

You've just seen a preview of Paradym's Single Property Site viewer as if you just "scrolled" down the page!

Now that you know the Difference between the Fusion Viewer and the Single Property Site Viewer....

Step 2: The Benefits to Paradym's Single Property Site Viewer

The Single Property Site can also be customized to the agents’ preference.  While the Fusion has it’s own benefits and customizations, the Property Site has the ability to take it to the next level for the real estate agent when it comes to showcasing their listing. 

Using the Property Site viewer, an agent can customize the viewing experience by adding additional content of their choice. 

Benefits summary:

*   Adding additional content to your tour template can be very beneficial to an agent in helping them win the attention of a customer and to hopefully turn the customer into a new lead for the agent! Adding additional content will make your Property Site stand out from the rest. It will turn your “template” into an elegant true story telling experience and a true personalized website for each of your listings!
*   What are some examples of things and types of content you can add to your Property Site? Enhanced videography, video, cell phone video footage, drone video footage, Matterport links, Documents, PDF’s, floor plans, surveys, links to your website or the company website, links to partnership websites i.e. preferred mortgage lender etc., links to local media outlets or other various websites, links to your active inventory, links to a lead generation page such as “Find Your Dream Home” etc.
