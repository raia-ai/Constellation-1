## CONSTELLATION1 CRM 

Updated Groups Module   
We’ve redesigned Contact Groups for better usability and an improved user interface. We’ve placed each Contact Groups section into its own tab.

  
**Contacts**  
In addition to the separate Contacts tab, we’ve made additional improvements, including adding the ability to select all contacts on all pages by checking the box at the top of the list. Previously, only contacts on the current page were selected.  
Also, we’ve replaced the Save button with an Auto-Save function. When adding or removing contacts, changes will be saved automatically.

Quick Email Confirmation  
We’ve updated the confirmation message after successfully sending a quick email.   
We’ve moved the message for better visibility and redesigned it to auto-dismiss after 10 seconds. The user will no longer have to click the X to clear the message.

Lead Assignment for Administrators  
We’ve improved the workflow for when lead administrators are manually assigning leads.   
In the Lead Assignment modal, the Search, Clear, and Assign buttons will not be enabled until the administrator enters text into the search box.

Cobrand Admin Accounts Page   
We’ve improved the usability of the Accounts page in the Cobrand Admin. When making changes to user accounts and then clicking Save, the administrator will now see a full-page confirmation overlay confirming the update is in progress. When the update has completed, the overlay will dismiss and the Accounts page will be active again.   
This provides better feedback to the administrator and prevents them from clicking Save multiple times. 

## CONSTELLATION1 WEBSITES

Enhanced Automated Valuation Model (AVM)  
We’ve enhanced the AVM on the company website to redirect consumers to the listing detail page if they search for the address of an active, pending, or contingent listing. The AVM is also known as “What’s My Home Worth” or “Home Value.”  
If a consumer attempts to use the AVM to find the value of a property that is active, pending, or contingent, the AVM will redirect them to the listing page, not the standard AVM page.   
This feature is available only on the company level website and is optional. It can be enabled for your company by request. Please contact your Constellation1 representative for more details.

Updated Listings Photo Viewer   
We’ve updated the toolbar on the photo viewer that displays listing photos on the property detail page.   
With this update, we’ve added more tool icons to allow the user to view photos in full screen, at 100% zoom, and play or pause the slideshow. We’ve also added tooltips to each of the buttons for a better user experience and made minor SEO and accessibility improvements.

BUG FIXES

**CRM**   
1\. We fixed an issue with links in Saved Search emails not working.   
Previously, when a consumer received a Saved Search or Saved Property Update email, the link to the property detail page was not working.   
Now, this issue has been resolved and consumers will be able to view the property detail page with one click, as expected. 

2\. We fixed an issue with the Quick Email Report showing an error message.   
Previously, when a user would run the Quick Email Report, they would get an error message.    
Now, this issue has been resolved and the user will no longer receive an error message. 

3\. We fixed and issue with the neighborhood report erroring when trying to print of save the report.   
Previously, when an agent created a neighborhood report, it would show an error message when they tried to save or print the report.   
Now, we fixed this issue. Agents are now able to save and print the neighborhood report without errors. 

**Website**  
1\. We fixed an issue with neighborhood and school data showing an error message on the website.  
Previously, the neighborhood and school report data was not displaying properly.   
Now, now the neighborhood and school report data display as expected. 

2\. We fixed an issue with users receiving an error when they tried recovering their password.   
Previously, when a user submitted a password reset request on the Forgot Password page, they received an error message.  
Now, when submitting a password reset request on the Forgot Password page, the user will receive an email at the address on file with instructions to create a new password as expected. 

3\. We fixed an issue with an error message showing when previewing some CMS website designs.   
Previously, when a user would preview a CMS website design, the preview would display an error message.    
Now, the error has been corrected. When previewing a website design, the preview will show as expected. 

4\. We fixed an issue with saved searches not saving the property type.  
Previously, when a user created a search and included a specific property type, the search did not save the property type.  
Now, when a user creates a saved search, the property type will be saved, and the user will receive regular email updates with the properties matching their search criteria.

5\. We fixed an issue with some agent websites not being created when they were imported into the system.   
Previously, when new agents were imported into the website system and configured to have a website, a website was not always automatically created for them.    
Now, this issue has been resolved. When new agents are imported and a website is configured for their account, a website will be created.
