# CRM - Lead Resource Contact Scoring

Contact Scoring quantifies website behavior by applying numerical values to key behaviors so you can better engage, market to, and manage these leads based on their score.  Affiliate Managers and Customer Account Managers will be able to see a color coded numerical score for both assigned and unassigned customers to quickly gauge customer’s activity looking for properties online.&#x20;

Contact Scoring assigns values to specific website activities and adjusts these values daily, and automatically, over a 30 day period for each active contact in the platform. By quantifying lead behavior, not only can you take the guess work out of what is a ‘hot lead’ and assignable, but your agents responsiveness will improve by being able to quickly identify those high-value customers with strong activity.

The score will also display on the Contact record for Agents and the Lead record for Admins.

The contact score will replace the “red star” icon.

The score will change dynamically as the contact performs specific behaviors (increases) and as time passes since the behavior was captured (decreases). Scores will display in five ranges and each range has a designated color.

Click the carrot icon to sort scores in ascending or descending order in the grid.

_Note: Leads must be accepted by the agent before the contact score will display._

**FAQs:**

How does Contact Scoring work?

When a contact has submitted a form or performed one of these activities or “behaviors” on your Affiliate Website, a number or “score” for this contact will be captured and calculated. This score can increase with additional activity. Likewise, as time passes the lead becomes less likely to convert so we decrease (degrade) the score, per activity, per day, based a 30 day period (days to monitor).

What are the activities being tracked?

The activities are as follows;

**Registration  - Property Inquiry**

**Inside Access - Website Inquiry**

**Showing Request - Saved Search**

**Listing Request - Saved Property**

**Smart Offer - Mobile Showing Request**

**Website Visit - Mobile Property Inquiry**

What are the colors that will display?

Scores will display in six ranges:

**Green - Top**

**Blue - Top-Middle**

**Brown - Middle**

**Orange - Bottom-Middle**

**Red - Bottom**

**Blank - No Score**

Will every customer have a contact score?

No\*\*.\*\* There are several scenarios where a contact score will not display.  Contact scores of zero will display as blank.  Contacts must be accepted by the assigned agent for the score to display.  Until the agent completes the acceptance process, the score will remain blank.  Contacts need to be active in order for a score to display.  If a contact migrated over as inactive, or becomes inactive (dormant), the score will remain blank.

What activities will create a viewable score?

If a contact registers for a website account, they will enable contact scoring.  The contact would be in the lowest range for this basic activity.&#x20;

What activities will move a contact into another range?

As an example, if the contact, after registering for an account, then signs up for Inside Access™, and Saves a few Properties or Searches, they will move into the next color range for these activities.  If the contact stays active, and submits more than one Listing Inquiry, they will move into the next color range indicating a very active contact.&#x20;

Will a CAM or agent-driven activity count in the score?

Yes.  If a CAM or agent sets up a Saved Search or Saved Property(s) for a customer, this activity will count in the contact score.

If an admin or agent manually registers a contact, does it get the registration contact score?

No.  Manually registering a client did not increase the contact score.  Only registrations coming directly from the website increases the contact score.&#x20;

If the customer logs out and then logs back in, will this increase the score? &#x20;

No. There is a pre-defined system wide “session” parameter of 3 hours.  If the customer logs out, then logs back in within the same 3 hour period, then the subsequent login count will not rise, except for the initial login.

**Contact Score Report**

Under the Reports link, there is a Contact Score report that gives a view of scores by contact name for the date range selected. Affiliate Managers and Customer Account Managers can also see the assigned agent for the contact.

The Contact Score report allows agents to run the report to be able to view and monitor their contacts scores.&#x20;

**Contact Score Report Details**

The report allows you to view details on specific contacts activities that reflect the total score of the contact.  The details will show increases based on specific contact activity, and decreases per activity per day based a 30 day period (days to monitor).
