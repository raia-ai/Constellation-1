## Bug Fixes

**Website**  
1\. Fixed an issue with re-saving a saved property. 

Previously, when a user edited or re-saved a saved property, they were getting an error, and their changes were not being saved. 

Now, this issue has been resolved. Editing or re-saving a saved property will save the changes without issue.

2\. Fixed an issue with some listing landing pages showing nearby zip codes without active listings. 

Previously, the listing landing page displayed links to zip code areas that didn’t have active listings. 

Now, this issue has now been resolved. For improved SEO, the listing landing page will only show links to nearby cities and zip codes that have active properties.

3\. Fixed an issue with the open house banner showing on the listing detail pages when an open house is scheduled more than 7 days in the future.

Previously, when an open house was scheduled more than 7 days in the future, the open house banner would show on the listing detail page and not include the date and time of the open house.

Now, this issue has been resolved. When an open house is scheduled and the date and time is beyond the defined time frame, the open house banner will not show on the listing detail page.
