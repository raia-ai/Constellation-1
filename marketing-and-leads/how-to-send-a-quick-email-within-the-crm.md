# How to Send a Quick Email Within the CRM

**CRM Quick Email** allows you to send email messages without having to exit the CRM system.

Email activity sent as part of an Action Plan as well as any email to an existing contact is tracked in the contact record. Frequently sent email messages can be saved and reused as part of the Quick Email feature.

To utilize the Quick Email functionality, login to your CRM.

Click on the **Quick Email** option.
