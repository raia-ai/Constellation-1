The friendly URL field is the URL you want to use on your site/marketing promotions. The Destination URL field will be the the URL consumers will get redirected to.

**Do note** that the Destination URL field **requires** that you specify the "http://" or "https://" part of the full URL. If you leave this out, the redirect will not work.
