If you are linking to a web page on the internet, enter the URL for that page in the **URL field**.

In the **Alt Text** field, include a short description of the link. This will show on the website when you mouse over the link.

Click **Publish** at the bottom to save. The top navigation can be moved to change the order in which it displays. You can also place them as a sub navigation item. Click on the grid pattern to drag the navigation tile up or down the list to change the order. To move a navigation item into a sub-nav, drag the navigation item and indent it under the top navigation where it should show.

**Example**: In the screen shot below, notice **My Listings** is indented under **About John**. My Listings will show as a sub-navigation under About John.
