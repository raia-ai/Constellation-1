# Recommended Property Emails FAQ | Constellation1 Customer Hub

## Overview

Recommended Properties and Similar Properties is an email program to automatically send weekly emails for various property milestones based on a client's saved property. Client's with a saved property will automatically be enrolled in the recommended properties emails.

There are four types of emails that can be enabled for your website.

The four types are:&#x20;

* Recommended Properties
* Properties Just Listed
* Properties with a Price Change
* Properties Recently Sold

**How Does it Work:**

* Consumer saves a property on your website&#x20;
* Properties are scored based on a geographic radius&#x20;
* Our recommendation algorithm searches for properties with a 10% expanded range based on the list price and number of bedrooms and bathrooms&#x20;
* Broker-owned listings ranked first&#x20;
* Consumer receives up to 10 customized recommendations via weekly email

**Who Can Use:** This feature is available to Brokerage clients and their agents

**What are the Benefits:** The platform proactively, recommends properties to consumers based on the most recent property they have saved.
