# Viewing Listing Alerts | Constellation1 Customer Hub

You already know what your clients are looking for and you’re sending Market Snapshots based on this info. Wouldn’t it be great if your clients are notified when things change in the areas they’re interested in? That’s what we’ve done! Whenever we find out about a new listing, a price change, or a sold listing, an alert is automatically sent on your behalf so they’ll hear about it from you!

You have 2 options for sending alerts—as they happen or once daily.

You can either send alerts the minute they happen, or you can send a summary email once a day that contains all of the new listing, price change and sold alerts that have occurred in the last 24 hours. The examples below show you the up-to-the-minute alerts, but if you’d rather send a summary email once a day, see the 2nd FAQ below for more details.

**What the listing alerts look like**

When a new listing comes on the market, there’s a price change, or a listing is sold, if the listing matches what they’re looking for, clients will be sent an email that looks like the one below.

They can click for more details (by clicking the address or More Details link), which displays a Listing Details page with property features, school information and more!
