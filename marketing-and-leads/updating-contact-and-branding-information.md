# Updating Contact and Branding Information

Updating Contact Information    &#x20;

Your account and customer facing information may very well be the same, but you have the option to have them be different.&#x20;

Your Profile Information is what Paradym uses to contact you and alert you of notifications such as leads, new feature announcements or any other actions you may need to take on your account.&#x20;

Your Branding information is what the public to sees so that they may contact you with questions on the tours for your properties.&#x20;

Your Contact Information is set in two different places – your account contact information and your customer facing contact information&#x20;

You may update your information from your Settings page in Profile and Branding.&#x20;

To update/edit your **Profile** information:&#x20;
