User Interface Updates\
We’ve made the following user interface updates:

**Overlay Messages**\
We’ve updated the position of various overlay messages within CRM. Many overlay messages have been relocated from the top left or top right corners to the center of the page for a better user experience. The messages are clearer and easier to read. \
Some of the updated messages will appear when:\
•    Adding a new contact\
•    Assigning a lead\
•    Sending a Quick Email\
•    Adding a new Calendar Activity&#x20;

## CONSTELLATION1 CRM MOBILE APP

Quick Emails\
We’ve improved the workflow when sending a Quick Email for a more friendly and intuitive user experience.

Previously, when a user sent a Quick Email, they would need to navigate away from and then back to the Quick Email page for it to refresh so they could send another email.

Now, when a Quick Email is sent, the page will refresh, so the user can send another email without having to navigate away.&#x20;

Locations of Interest \
We’ve added labels to the location elements in the Location(s) of Interest field. Labels for City, State, and Zip Code now display next to the relevant information.&#x20;

## CONSTELLATION1 WEBSITES

Mortgage Calculator Customization\
We’ve updated the mortgage calculator on the Property Detail page to allow a company to incorporate their color scheme. \
The chart can now display the primary and secondary colors of your company for a more cohesive, branded experience. \
This is an optional setting that can be enabled for each company. Please reach out to your Constellation1 representative for details.

### BUG FIXES

**CRM** \
1\. We fixed an issue with a “processing” overlay message not closing when editing an Action Plan.\
Previously, when editing an Action Plan, then saving your changes, an overlay message would pop up indicating the system was working to save your changes. This pop-up didn’t dismiss. \
Now, when editing and saving an Action Plan, the processing message will briefly display as expected. &#x20;

**CRM Mobile App**\
1\. We fixed an issue with previewing Action Plan emails in the CRM mobile app. \
Previously, a user was unable to preview an Action Plan email message because the preview window would be blank.\
Now, when a user taps the Preview button when viewing an Action Plan email, a preview of the email will display.&#x20;

2\. We fixed an issue with Recent Activity not refreshing.\
Previously, when a user would update a lead that should also have been reflected in the User Activity section, the Recent Activity statistics wouldn’t update.\
Now, we have corrected this issue. Recent Activities will refresh every 10 seconds. &#x20;

**Websites**\
1\. We fixed an issue with an error message showing for the Neighborhood Report on Property Detail pages. \
Previously, due to a broken database connection, the Neighborhood Report was showing an error message. \
Now, the connection has been corrected and the error message no longer displays.&#x20;

2\. We fixed an issue with the design preview link not working.\
Previously, in the design section of a CMS website admin, when a user clicked the Preview button to preview a design, the link was broken.  \
Now, we have corrected the link to the CMS website design previews. When a user clicks the Preview button, a preview of the design will open in a new window.&#x20;

3\. We fixed an issue with the Forgot Password link delivering an unexpected error message. \
Previously, when a user clicked the Forgot Password link on the CRM login page, they were directed to a page showing an “Unexpected Error” message. \
Now, the error has been corrected and the user will now be directed to a page where they can enter their username and receive information to update their password.
