**Assigning Commission Plans to Agents**

A commission plan can be assigned to an agent in one of two ways:

*   Manually assign one at a time within the agent's profile via the Commission Details tab and selecting the Commission Plan from the drop down **OR**
*   Assign "in Bulk" which will only work if:
    *   the Commission Plan is dependent upon an Anniversary Start date and the agents being assigned have an Anniversary Start Date entered already OR
    *   Flat Rate plans will assign regardless if an Anniversary Start date is entered for the agent or not

To assign a commission plan to multiple agents "in Bulk":

*   On the left navigation bar select **Agents**
*   Place check to left of agents you wish to assign a specific commission plan 
*   Select **Action / Assign**

The fields that can be allocated to another agent are Ends, Sales Volume, Agent Side Gross Commission, Adjusted Agent Gross Commission and Company Net.

**Bonus Override** allows users to configure an automatic commission payment (based on a percentage or dollar amount) from the transaction to another contact or agent.  Examples of these types of payments which are NOT subject to a commission plan could be a recruiting bonus or an assistant.

**Agent History** allows users to make a manual adjustment of commission related amounts if needed. It can be used to give credit to agents for commission earned at a previous brokerage or if you migrated from another accounting/commission type platform saving you time to reenter previously closed transactions.

This tab is only visible if you integrate with a supported accounting application.  It will display a synopsis of each agents' individual invoice including the Invoice No, Status (paid/unpaid), Invoice Date, Description, Invoice Amount, Balance Amount and Due Date.
