# FiveStreet: Lead Email Parsing | Constellation1 Customer Hub

**FiveStreet: How does my @fivestreet.me forwarding address work?**

Your @fivestreet.me forwarding address is how your leads will get into the FiveStreet system. This forwarding email address acts as a middleman between your lead sources and your email inbox.

Your personalized @fivestreet.me email address can be put into any accepted lead source as your primary contact email address. Your leads are then directed to FiveStreet. If we get any emails that we don’t recognize as leads (like marketing emails from your lead provider) we forward them on to your FiveStreet account email address.

In the case of almost all lead sources, the prospect will never see this @fivestreet.me email address as the sites don’t display your contact email address.

We automatically assign you an @fivestreet.me email address when you create your FiveStreet account. It can be found on the Lead Sources tab of FiveStreet.

Users can change the prefix of their @fivestreet.me email address by following these steps: 

1\. Log into FiveStreet.   
2\. Click Lead Sources along the top.   
3\. Click Change This Address in the top section.   
4\. Replace the existing prefix with the new one.   
5\. Click Save.
