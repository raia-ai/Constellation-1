## RELEASE DETAILS 

Paradym Now Supports Automated Instagram Posts  
We’ve added a new feature that supports automated Instagram posts. This allows users to share content on Instagram more easily. Previously, Paradym would generate posts automatically, but users had to manually carry the posts over to Instagram to publish them.  
This update also includes the Broker Broadcast feature, allowing brokers to share their content on Instagram.

Broker Security Options  
We’ve added a new security option to broker accounts allowing brokers to manage their Broker Security password.  
Under Account, we've added a new Security Options section where brokers can update or change their Broker Security password.

Bug Fixes   
1\. We fixed an issue with panoramic images failing to stitch together.   
Previously, when Create Panoramic Image was selected, the stitching process would fail, and the user would receive an error message.  
Now, this issue has been resolved and panoramic images will be stitched together successfully. 

2\. We fixed an issue with viewing listings associated with offices and agents on ListHub.   
Previously, when searching for listings on ListHub, the user would get an error message.   
Now, this issue has been resolved and users can find listings without errors.   
   
3\. We fixed an issue with property tours being created without music when using the Paradym mobile app.   
Previously, when a property tour was created using the Paradym mobile app, the musical score did not play. The root cause was an improperly formatted link to the music.   
Now, this issue has been resolved and background music will play for property tours created using the mobile app.   
   
4\. We fixed an issue with deleting posts from Instagram.  
Previously, when trying to delete an Instagram post from Paradym, the post would only be deleted from Paradym and would remain on the user’s Instagram feed.  
Now, this issue has been corrected. Deleting an Instagram post in Paradym will also delete the post on Instagram. 

5\. We fixed an issue with Broker Broadcast posts on Instagram not including the agent’s name when posting to the connected agent’s account.   
Previously, when a broker sent a Broker Broadcast post to Instagram, their connected agent’s name would not show in the post published on the agent’s Instagram feed. This issue was caused when an agent’s Paradym account was only connected to Instagram and not to Facebook, too.   
Now, this issue has been corrected. When an agent is connected to Instagram but not Facebook, the agent’s name will still be included in the post on the agent’s Instagram feed when the post is part of a Broker Broadcast.
