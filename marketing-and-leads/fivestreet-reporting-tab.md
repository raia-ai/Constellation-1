**FiveStreet: Reporting Tab**

The Reporting tab provides a variety of informative graphs and reports to help you better understand how FiveStreet is performing. Brokers will see brokerage-level information, while agents under a brokerage will see a filtered view with only their own details.

The data can be downloaded as a CSV file by clicking By Agents or By Sources in the top right under Export Claimed Lead Data. The data is defined by the date range selected at the top of the page, and data is available from June 25th, 2018 onwards.

· Where am I getting most of my leads from?

· What are my zip codes with the highest average price?

· What is my SMS response rate?
