## Constellation1 CRM Release Details

CoBrand Admin

We’ve added the option for company admins to add email addresses to the Opt-Out email list.  
Administrators have been able to remove email addresses from the opt-out list. Now to provide more complete administration functionality, we’ve added an “Add Email(s)” button to the Opt-Out page. Administrators can now add email addresses to the opt-out list to stop company level emails from being sent to the consumer. This update will also be recorded on the contact history.

Add one or more email addresses to the opt out list. Multiple emails need to be separated by a semi-colon, comma or a new line (carriage return).

## Constellation1 Website Release Details

Photo Display for Sold Listings 

In a recent release we added the ability for a broker or MLSs to define the number of photos that can be displayed on their websites for sold listings.   
In this release we’ve enhanced this functionality to allow brokers and MLSs to further define what photos if any should be displayed on sold listings. 

Options include: 

•    Primary photo. Only the primary image will be displayed. This is the default setting.  
•    Display all photos.  
•    Set the number of photos. A broker or MLS can choose to display the first 1 to 5 photos.   
•    Map Only. No photos will be displayed, instead a map will be displayed showing the location of the property.   
•    Hide All. No photos will be displayed, nor will the map be displayed. 

This update does not require any changes to listing page layouts and can be implemented at any time.   
For more information or to have the settings updated for your website, please contact your Constellation1 representative. 

##   
Bug Fixes  

**Website**  
1\. Fixed an issue with clients deleting saved searches from the website admin.  
Previously, when a client logged into their client account and tried to delete a saved search, the saved search was not being deleted.   
Now, this issue has been resolved. 

  
2\. Fixed an issue with consumers of the website getting an error message when navigating to their login page.   
Previously, when a consumer navigated to their Sign In page, they were briefly presented with an error message. This didn’t prevent them from logging in but it did interrupt the workflow and caused some confusion.   
Now, this issue has been resolved. 

## Technology Updates 

**CRM**

1.  We've updated the time zone conversion utility to provide more consistent and reliable time calculations. As part of this update, we have also removed the "Adjust for daylight saving time" checkbox from the user's calendar settings in their personal profile.

**Websites**  
1\.  We have removed Facebook as a way for customers to login or create an account on the website. Currently, users are encountering an error when attempting to log in using their Facebook account. We are working diligently with Facebook to correct this issue.
