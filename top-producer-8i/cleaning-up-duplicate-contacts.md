# Cleaning Up Duplicate Contacts | Constellation1 Customer Hub

Duplicate contacts can occur in Top Producer in a variety of different ways, either after a data import, receiving duplicate leads or manually entering the same contact into the database.

  
The steps to find duplicate contacts can currently only be done in the Top Producer 8i version, and here are the steps:

1\. Log into Top Producer 8i.  
2\. Hover over Contacts and click Show Duplicates.

3\. You’ll find an option in the top right corner that can be used to toggle between duplicate contacts based on Name or Email Address.

4\. Click the box beside each of the same duplicate. You have to choose the same name when merging duplicates – you cannot select them all and have Top Producer 8i automatically merge them for you. This is because manual intervention will be necessary in the event there’s conflicting information (see the next step).  
5\. Click Merge Selected in the bottom left.  
6\. The following popup will appear:

7\. The section on the right will display the information that will be kept in the contact record after the merge is complete. Any conflicting information will be designated with an exclamation point. If the information is not what is to be kept, click the edit button to the right, choose the information to keep and click Ok.
