# Top Producer 8i: Microsoft Edge Configuration for Top Producer Editor

### Configuring Microsoft Edge to work with Top Producer Editor

To edit a personal Flyer, Presentation, Envelope, Label, or Postcard template, you will need to login via Internet Explorer, or Microsoft Edge (Internet Explorer mode). This is due to a change in technology as the Top Producer Editor plugin longer works with other browsers.

Here are the steps to enable the option to switch to Internet Explorer mode in Microsoft Edge:

1.  Open ![Edge-1](https://support.topproducer.com/wp-content/uploads/Edge-1.png) Microsoft Edge.
2.  Click on the 3-dots   in the upper right.
3.  Click _Settings_.
4.  From the Settings menu on the left side, click _Default browser_.
5.  Under _Internet Explorer compatibility, set Allow sites to be reloaded in Internet Explorer mode (IE mode)_ to **Allow**.

6.  Under _Internet Explorer mode pages_, click **Add a page**.

7.  From the _Add a page_ box, type in [https://www.topproducer8i.com,](https://www.topproducer8i.com,/) then click **Add**.

8.  Top Producer 8i ([https://www.topproducer8i.com](https://www.topproducer8i.com/)) will now open in Internet Explorer mode for 30 days from the date it was added.  You will need to repeat steps 6 & 7 once the date under _Expires_ has passed, if you intend on editing any of the Flyer, Presentation, Envelope, Label, or Postcard templates again beyond that date.
