**Top Producer 8i: Viewing a personal template results in an Internal Error message**

  
In most cases, when an internal error message appears when attempting to view or print a template in Top Producer 8i, it’s most likely that the template being used was involved in the Netapp corruption issue that occurred during server migration a few years ago.

This server migration issue affected all personal templates that were created, or last edited before December 20, 2021. This includes letters, emails, labels, postcards, envelopes and presentations.

There unfortunately is no work-around or fix for this as those templates were not able to be recovered. They will need to be manually recreated in Top Producer 8i.
