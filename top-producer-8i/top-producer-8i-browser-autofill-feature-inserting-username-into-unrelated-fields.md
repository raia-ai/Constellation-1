# Top Producer 8i: Browser autofill feature inserting username into unrelated fields

Top Producer 8i users can sometimes run into an issue where they see their Top Producer username automatically appearing in various fields while using the program. If this isn’t noticed, then it can cause problems when attempting to perform a search, and/or insert the wrong information into Top Producer 8i when adding or editing a contact for example.

This is caused by Top Producer pulling the username from the browser’s saved password list, and below are the steps to resolve this. Note that the customer will need to choose “No” if the browser asks to save your password when logging into Top Producer 8i.

Google Chrome Users:

1\. Click Customize and Control Google Chrome in the upper right (the 3 dots) and click Settings.  
2\. Click Autofill and Passwords on the left.  
3\. Click Google Password Manager.  
4\. Find and click on Topproducer8i.com in the list. Note that there may be a prompt to enter the Windows password in order to continue.  
5\. Click the Delete button to remove the saved Top Producer 8i password. The same will need to be done if there are multiple usernames listed.  
6\. Close the Settings tab.

Microsoft Edge Users:

1\. Click the 3 dots in the top right corner of edge, then click Settings.

2\. On the main Profiles section, scroll down until you find the "Passwords" option and click on it.

3\. Find and click on Topproducer8i.com in the list. Note that there may be a prompt to enter the Windows password in order to continue.

4\. Click the Delete button to remove the saved Top Producer 8i password. The same will need to be done if there are multiple usernames listed.
