**Refresh Share Attachment Facebook Cover Photo Missing** 

You may notice some of your posts looking like the following below.   
Your tour shared but there is no photo that you can click on to preview the tour.

When this happens, unfortunately it is due to Facebook timing out before they are able to insert the image thus it just showing the linked area below in the post. 

There is a way around this, however, with some quick manual work. 

All you need to do is hit that **three dot menu** on the **upper right** portion of the post. 

There will be a plethora of options on here but typically the last one will say "**Refresh Share Attachment**".

Another window will appear that should have the photo in it. 

Hit **Save** and **refresh** the page. 

If it is still missing, try this step once more as sometimes once is not enough for Facebook to pull it through. 

Viola! Your attachment (photo) should now be visible. 

If you are experiencing an issue where you have done this step several times and the photo is still missing, you may need to call us.

There is a debugging tool that can be used to essentially force it to refresh. This, however, is not common to occur. 

Still have questions?   
Give us a call, chat, or email!
