**Refresh Share Attachment Facebook Cover Photo Missing**&#x20;

You may notice some of your posts looking like the following below. \
Your tour shared but there is no photo that you can click on to preview the tour.&#x20;

When this happens, unfortunately it is due to Facebook timing out before they are able to insert the image thus it just showing the linked area below in the post.&#x20;

There is a way around this, however, with some quick manual work.&#x20;

All you need to do is hit that **three dot menu** on the **upper right** portion of the post.&#x20;

There will be a plethora of options on here but typically the last one will say "**Refresh Share Attachment**".

Another window will appear that should have the photo in it.&#x20;

Hit **Save** and **refresh** the page.&#x20;

If it is still missing, try this step once more as sometimes once is not enough for Facebook to pull it through.&#x20;

Viola! Your attachment (photo) should now be visible.&#x20;

If you are experiencing an issue where you have done this step several times and the photo is still missing, you may need to call us.

There is a debugging tool that can be used to essentially force it to refresh. This, however, is not common to occur.&#x20;
