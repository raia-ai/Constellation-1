## Issue 2: Paradym by Constellation1 July 2023 Release Notes

**Known Problems**:

- with agent account interfaces not displaying correctly when the account was transitioned from under a broker account to an individual agent account.   Previously, when an agent account that was previously associated with a broker account was changed to a standalone agent account, the user interface would not display correctly.    Now, this issue has been resolved.
- with Instagram using the first photo posted to a Tour and not the designated cover photo.    Previously, when posting a photo tour to Instagram, Instagram would display the first photo uploaded to the Tour instead of the cover photo selected by the user.   Now, this issue has been resolved. When posting photo tours to Instagram, the cover photo will be the feature image, not the first photo the user added.
