Now, we’ve improved the document handling process to accommodate a large number attached to a signing session.
- message.   Now, when a signing session invitation is re-sent, the link will work and take the signer to the signing session.
- with the incorrect color displaying for the left navigation.    Previously, in specific cases, when logging in to eSign, the left navigation didn’t display the default blue color, causing the text in the left navigation bar to be unreadable.    Now, we’ve corrected this issue, and the default blue color will display when logging in to eSign 2.0.
- with markups and tags disappearing when placed too close to the edge of a document when using eSign on a mobile device.    Previously, when a markup or signer tag was placed in the margins or too close to the edge of a document, the markup or tag would disappear and be removed from the document.    We’ve corrected this behavior to allow markups and tags to be placed close to the edge and even a little over the edge of a document.    Note: It is still best practice to keep markups and tags within the document margins.
- with the action menu presenting invalid options to the session sender and reviewer after the reviewer has completed their session.    Previously, when a reviewer completed their session, the action menu on the Session Info page displayed invalid options, including the ability to resend the session.    Now, after a reviewer has completed their session, the menu on the Session Info page will only display valid options, preventing the sender and reviewer from accidentally initiating an invalid action while a signing session is active.
- with users getting an error message saying, “Object reference not set to an instance of an object” when there were many documents attached to a signing session.   Previously, if a signing session included a large number of documents, and the user tried to edit or change the order of the documents, they would receive this error.   Now, we’ve improved the document handling process to accommodate a large number attached to a signing session.
- with allowing signers to access a signature session after they declined or delegated their signer role.   Previously, even after a signer declined or delegated a signing session, they were still able to access the signing session without accepting the disclosure agreements.    Now, if a signer declines or delegates their signer role for a session and does not accept the disclosure agreements, they will not be able to access the signing session.
- with the system not sending a webhook after a signing session has been canceled.    Previously, when a signing session was canceled, the system did not generate a webhook to notify other applications of the change.    Now, when a signing session is canceled, a webhook will be generated and sent out as expected.
- with being unable to cancel a signing session if it included a file with a long name.    Previously, when there was a file with a long name attached to a signing session, canceling the session would cause an error.    Now, when canceling a signing session with an attached file with a long name, the session will cancel as expected without an error.
- with the Certificate of Authenticity not showing a green check mark to indicate the signing session has been successfully completed.    Previously, due to a change in the DevExpress settings, the green check mark didn’t display on the Certificate of Authenticity.    Now, the settings in DevExpress have been updated to display the green check mark on the COA.
- with the Review Documents button incorrectly displaying the words Start KBA after KBA authentication had been completed by a document reviewer.    Previously, after a document reviewer has completed their KBA authentication, the button to review the documents would still be labeled Start KBA, causing confusion.    Now, after a document reviewer has completed KBA authentication, the button to review documents will be labeled correctly.
- with signing sessions completing after a reviewer completed their session.     Previously, when a document reviewer completed their review of the document, the signing session would be marked as compete, even if there were still incomplete signing sessions.    Now, the signing session will not be marked as complete until all signing sessions have been completed, even after a document reviewer has completed their review.
- with second signing session invitation links not working.    Previously, the link in the second signing session invitation to open the session was not working and resulted in an error message.   Now, when a signing session invitation is re-sent, the link will work and take the signer to the signing session.

- that prevented CMAP and CMAF brokers from accessing their weekly summary report.    Previously, when a broker would try to access their weekly summary report, they would get an error message.    Now, when a broker accesses their weekly summary report, the report will open.

Now, we’ve added additional validation to Auto Tours to monitor and prevent unwanted changes from happening.
- with Auto Tours not being created for new listings from Realogy. Previously, we were not able to pull listing photos from Realogy using the URL they provided for new listings. Now, after working with Realogy, we’re able to access listing photos for new listings on the Realogy system.

- with Knowledge-Based Authentication not being responsive to touch on mobile devices.    Previously, when a signer would try to authenticate their identity with KBA, some fields, such as State and Country, were not responding to touch.    Now, the touch response for these fields has been restored when using a mobile device.
- with a signer getting an error message after declining a signing session.    Previously, when a signer would decline a signing session, they would see an error message.    Now, when a signer declines a signing session, they will see a modal prompting them to provide a reason for declining the signing session, as expected.

- with a completed signing session showing Next Signer instead of Completed on the Signing History and Session pages.    Previously, when a signing session was completed, the History and Session pages would show Next Signer instead of Completed.    Now, when a session has been completed, the History and Session pages will show the correct status of Completed.

- with PDF documents failing to upload when some fillable form fields are left blank.    Previously, when a PDF document was uploaded to a signing session and some of the fillable form fields were left blank, the document would fail to upload and display an error message.    Now, PDF documents with blank fillable form fields will upload successfully.
- with some PDF documents with fillable form fields not converting the data in the form fields.    Previously, in some cases, when a PDF document with fillable form fields was uploaded to a signing session, the data added to the fillable form fields did not convert. This left the fields blank.   Now, when a PDF document with fillable form fields is uploaded to a signing session, the data in the form fields will convert as expected.
- with the documents ZIP file not downloading documents.    Previously, when the signer opted to view the documents during a signing session, they were presented with the option to download the documents in a ZIP file.

## Issue 84: Website Admin > Photo Editor Error

**Known Problems**:

- Are you attempting to upload images to a listing that already has images from an MLS board?

## Issue 104: IPhone - Photo Display Issues

**Known Problems**:

- occurs when the user takes a photo with an iPhone in a certain way. Currently, when we pull the images in from the MLS we do not have a way to ignore the EXIF value like the website application does for other operating systems.
- reported for this case, the best way to get it resolved would be for a new photo to be uploaded with an EXIF value of 0000. This value can be checked/edited manually by checking under the photo's details tab. Alternatively you can suggest taking new photos using a camera that is not iOS and uploading those images to the MLS.
- originated back when iOS 5 was released, because the operating system introduced the culprit: the ability to snap a photo with the phone’s volume up button. Basically, the camera’s sensor doesn’t realize when you rotate the phone to take a picture. Supposedly, your phone doesn’t correct the orientation itself because doing so would make it harder for the phone to take another picture immediately after the last. Instead, the iPhone writes the orientation info to the EXIF data of the image.

- Term Deposit/GIC, select date that the Term Deposit/GIC was issued, enter the Term/GIC Certificate Number, place check in Post Immediately and **Save**. *   This will create a journal entry moving the deposit out of the escrow/trust bank account and into the general ledger account configured for your Term Deposits/GIC's.
