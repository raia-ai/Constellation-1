- with text messages sent by the broker not being received by the recipient.    Previously, when a broker would send an SMS/Text message, the messages were not being received by the recipient, due to configuration changes made by Twillio.    Now, When a broker sends an SMS/Text message, the message will be delivered.

- with listing tours not posting to FMLS.    Previously, when a tour is created for agents associated with FMLS, their tours were not being posted to FMLS due to a change in the FMLS login system.    Now, this issue has been corrected. Tours will be posted to FMLS.
- with changing an agent’s office association.    Previously, when a broker changed an agent’s office, the system didn’t save the change.    Now, when a broker changes an agent’s office, the change will be saved as expected.
