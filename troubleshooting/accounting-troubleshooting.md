## Issue 56: Constellation1 Commissions July 2023 Release Notes v2.4

**Known Problems**:

- with canceling partial payments.    Previously, the system allowed a user to cancel a partial payment without reversing the transaction.

Now, we have resolved this issue and will alert the user with a warning message that partial payment transactions must be reversed before they can be canceled.
- where the Agent Income Ledger wouldn’t correctly indicate that an agent represented both sides when the transaction included agent awards.    Previously, when a transaction included an agent award and the agent represented both sides of the transaction, the Agent Income Ledger displayed either Buying or Selling as the side.   Now, the Agent Income Ledger will display Both when the agent represents both sides of the transaction with an agent award.
- with certain mappings in the Franchise Reporting section inadvertently changing.    Previously, in the Franchise Reporting section, the Transaction Type, Lead Source, and Favorites mappings would sometimes change, even after being saved.   Now, we’ve fixed this issue and when the various mappings are saved, they will no longer change unexpectedly.

- with selecting a payee in an agent record.   Previously, when selecting Company as the payee, the related fields didn’t update.
