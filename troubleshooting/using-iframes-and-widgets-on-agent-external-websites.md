# Using Iframes And Widgets On Agent External Websites

When agents have their own websites outside of a Real Estate Digital domain, they are allowed to create i-frames directly to their websites targeting a Real Estate Digital website. However, if the i-frame does not display correctly, it is not because there is a problem with the Real Estate Digital domain, it is because the code that revolves around the i-frame is written improperly. To prevent this from happening it is ideal that the individual learn the basics of HTML and CSS programming to understand how to use the elements and tags. There are plenty of online sources that can help the individual learn these languages. You can start by simply googling HTML and CSS tutorials.

Below you will find an example of a website that used an i-frame where the code that revolved around the i-frame was written improper.&#x20;
