# Troubleshoot Facebook Share Issues | Constellation1 Customer Hub

If you are experiencing issues with sharing listings over to Facebook (such as issues with the image that appears or the information that appears), try these steps:

1\. Go to [https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/) and enter the link for the listing. Then click "Debug".

2\. See if there are any warnings/errors with the listing that can be resolved. For images, Facebook requires the image to be at least 200px by 200px, which can cause some issues with how the image is displayed. That warning will appear in this section.

If these steps do not resolve your issue, please feel free to open a new HelpDesk ticket.
