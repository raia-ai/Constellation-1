# Using eMail2eSign | Constellation1 Customer Hub

eMail2eSign allows users to email documents as attachments directly into their eSign account. This feature automatically creates a new Session and sends an email to the user with a single sign-on link to continue building the Session. It's a convenient way to start, create, and send documents directly from your iPad, Android, Windows, or any internet enabled devices with access to a browser and your email. Simply attach documents in an email and send it, click the link in your confirmation email to automatically log in and finalize your eSign Session.

**Note:** eMail2eSign only works when you email documents using the same email address that you have in your eSign account.

**Using eMail2eSign:**

**Additional Uploads:** If you have forgotten a document or two, you can add in additional ones by sending a new email to the address shown in the confirmation email. This email address is specific to the session you've just created.
