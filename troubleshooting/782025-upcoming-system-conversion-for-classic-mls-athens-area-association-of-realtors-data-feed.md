# 7/8/2025 - Upcoming System Conversion for CLASSIC MLS (Athens Area Association of REALTORS) Data Feed

**Effective Tuesday, July 8, 2025, an emergency vendor system conversion** will be implemented for this data feed. We sincerely apologize for the short notice as we were informed of this change very late and are working quickly to keep you updated.

Due to the nature of this emergency conversion:

*   **The $reconvert=true flag will not be functional until July 8th** and will need to be referenced for your incremental updates **until July 15th**.
    
*   You may continue accessing the legacy version of the data using **$reconvert=false through Tuesday, July 15, 2025**.
    
*   The OSN (Originating System Name) will remain unchanged.
    

What’s Changing:

*   **All key values across resources will change as part of the conversion**
    

*   ListingKey, MemberKey, OfficeKey, etc.
    

*   **All ID values will now include a "CM" prefix**
    

*   ListingId "123456" → CM123456
    
*   MemberMlsId "1234" → CM1234
    
*   OfficeMlsId "ABCD" → CMABCD
