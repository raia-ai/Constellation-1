# Listing Images - Photo Quality

This article covers where RED gets a listing’s images from and reasons that could be causing photos to display with low quality.

**How to Troubleshoot**

It is important to know that RED gets images for listings directly from the MLS, meaning we pull what is provided in that feed by the agents. You can check the listing image’s quality by comparing the image you’re receiving from RED to images for the same listing on other sites.

_\*For reliable comparisons, use sites like Realtor.com or Redfin as they pull a listing’s images from the MLS as RED does. Other sites such as Zillow allow agents to upload their own images, therefore the images are coming from a different source than how RED is receiving it.\*_

If the image quality is the same on the sites you compared to, then the agent will have to reload a better quality image to the MLS. It is also important to note that expanding or compressing images can change their quality.

**Do I open a ticket with RED?**

If the image is looking good on other sites but not your website then, yes, please open a ticket with RED with the following information so we can investigate further:

1) We will need the name of the MLS board and listing ID of the image in question.

2) URLs to where you’re viewing the image on your website or data set

3) URLs to other websites comparing images of the **same listing**

**Suggestions of working to communicate back to the agents:**

If RED’s image is different than other data sources or sites, then please open a ticket and inform your agents that this is being investigated by your data vendor and should be resolved shortly.

If all of the images are blurry on each site you troubleshoot on, try giving the agent example URLs of the other site and explain to them how we receive the data through the MLS. Potentially make some suggestions to them such as

*   Using a professional photographer
*   Not enlarging photos when uploading
*   Using a clearer camera
