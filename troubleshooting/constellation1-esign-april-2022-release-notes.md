## RELEASE SUMMARY

**Signing Session Information:** Updated Rename Document modal.

**Account Profile:** Updated confirmation message when changing notification options.

## RELEASE DETAILS  

Updated Rename Document Modal

To make it easier to rename a document, we’re now displaying the current document name in the New Name field in the Rename Document modal.

In the Actions menu under Documents on the signing session information page, users have the option to rename the document. Previously, the Rename Document modal didn’t display the current document name. Now we’re displaying it in the New Name field to make it easier to modify. This update also applies to bulk send sessions.

Architecture

We’ve updated the Java processes for converting documents to PDF for improved system efficiency and functionality when processing PDF documents.

BUG FIXES

*   Fixed an issue with passwords containing special characters causing an error. Now when creating or updating passwords, special characters will not cause an error. For a more secure login, passwords should contain at least one special character.  
    
*   Fixed an issue with documents not showing the page count in the document thumbnail display. Documents will now show the number of pages the document has at the top of the document thumbnail display.
