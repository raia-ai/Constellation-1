# Paradym by Constellation1 July 2024 Release Notes

Production Release July 2024

## Release Summary

**Co-Listing Agents:** Added support for co-listing agents to market their listings.    
**Bug Fixes**

## Release Details

  
Added Support for Co-List Agent

Paradym now supports co-listing agents, allowing them full access to market properties where they are the co-listing agent. 

This update grants co-listing agents the same access to their shared listings as the primary listing agent. Properties will now be handled identically for both primary and co-listing agents.

Additionally, when configured, the system will automatically create and share property tours on social media, as well as generate blog posts.

Bug Fixes 

1\. We fixed an issue with html markup language showing in the title of social media posts on LinkedIn.

Previously, the title of social media posts shared on LinkedIn showed special characters that are part of the html code for quote marks, ampersand or other special characters.

Now, this issue has been resolved.

2\. We fixed an issue with the office name running off the right edge of the Info screen on My Tours. 

Previously, on the details page of a property Tour, if the office name was too long, it would overflow the right edge of the Info section.

Now, this issue has been resolved. 

3\. We fixed an issue with thumbnail images not showing in the Post Summary section of a user’s account. 

Previously, thumbnail images were not showing on blog and listing posts in the Post Summary section of a user’s account.

Now, this issue has been resolved. 

4\. We fixed an issue with listing blog posts not showing in the Tour Timeline.

Previously, when a listing is shared via blog post, the post was not showing on the Tour Timeline on a user’s account. 

Now, this issue has been resolved.
