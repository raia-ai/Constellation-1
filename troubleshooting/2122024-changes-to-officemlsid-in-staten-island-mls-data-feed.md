# 2/12/2024 - Changes to OfficeMlsId in Staten Island MLS Data Feed

We would like to inform you that on 2/12/2024, the Staten Island Multiple Listing Service (MLS) data feed will undergo a vendor system conversion. As a result of this conversion, there will be a modification to the OfficeMlsIds.

Following the conversion, the OfficeMlsIds will be prefixed with an "o." For instance, the old format (10106) will transition to the new format (o10106).
