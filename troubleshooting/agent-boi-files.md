# Agent BOI Files | Constellation1 Customer Hub

The Agent BOI file contains agent records. The agent records have several different fields about an agent's account. From the agent's name, internal id, mls membership ids, phone #s, to website/social media urls, biographies and service providers. As mentioned there are several fields for this type of file and errors can happen that could prevent the record form updating successfully. An example would be that an url an agent is trying to use is already in use with a different agent. 

The Agent Photo BOI file contains images for each agent. The images' file names are all set to their corresponding agents' internal id. That is how the photo gets saved to the correct agent when processed.
