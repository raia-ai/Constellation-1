## Release Details

Coming Soon! Mobile View Document Zoom

The mobile application's document viewing experience during a signing session has been updated to allow users to zoom in and out on documents, rather than zooming the entire page. This improves usability when viewing documents, as compared to the previous zoom functionality which affected the whole page.&#x20;

This feature is scheduled to be released between the May and June releases. &#x20;

Bug Fixes

1\. GPES-4790\
We fixed an issue with the font size increasing when a signer tag is enlarged.

Previously, when a signer tag was placed on a document then the tag was resized to be larger, the font size also increased.

Now, fonts will remain the set size when a tag is resized as expected.&#x20;
