# Paradym by Constellation1 September 2022 Release Notes

Production Release #82: September 21, 2022

## RELEASE SUMMARY

**Architecture:** Improved password security for the desktop and mobile applications.  

**Bug Fixes**

## RELEASE DETAILS 

Improved Password Security 

We’ve removed user passwords from both the broker and agent views in the desktop application to improve password security for all users.  

Passwords will no longer be available in the Paradym application, and we will no longer send passwords via email. Users who have forgotten their password or need to update it will need to follow the Forgot Password flow on the Paradym login page.  
[https://my.paradym.com/login](https://my.paradym.com/login)

This update also includes improved password security on the mobile app. Now when a user follows the Forgot Password workflow on the mobile app, they will receive an email directing them to the Paradym login page, where they can update their password through the desktop Forgot Password flow.   
   
Bug Fixes 

•    We fixed an issue with the checkout page showing an error message in some cases. 

Previously, when a user would go to the checkout page and try to complete their transaction, they would get an “Oops” error message. 

Now, users will be able to complete the checkout process from the checkout page as expected.  

•    We fixed an issue with the Flyer Builder not showing a thumbnail image or the correct thumbnail image of a newly created flyer. 

Previously, when a user created a multi-page flyer, the thumbnail image didn’t show, or it would show the last page of the flyer. 

Now, when a multi-page flyer is created, the thumbnail image will show the correct page. 

•    We fixed an issue with brokers being unable to send messages to their agents. 

Previously, when a broker would go to Account Management > Emails , the modal would show an oversized display of the message editor.

Now, when opening the Email modal, a regular-sized editor will display, so the broker can draft and send email messages to their agents. 

•    We fixed an issue with overlapping and jumbled text showing on a broker’s Account List when viewed as a List. 

Previously, when a broker would view their agent Account List in the List view, text in the list view would overlap or display as jumbled, making it difficult to read. 

Now, when a broker views their agent Account List in the List view, the text will display correctly and legibly. 

  
•    We fixed an issue with the Tour Search showing agents tours that belong to other agents. 

Previously, an agent could search and select all the tours from their company. 

Now, agents will only be able to search for their own tours. Brokers can still search all the tours from their company.
