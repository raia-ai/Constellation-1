**We strongly encourage users create customized templates of their own, as any new bookmarks, additions, enhancements, etc. will automatically update the master template.**

All documents downloaded from Commissions Online will be saved to the Downloads folder of users PC/laptop.

Navigate to the Downloads folder, enable editing if prompted and begin.  Insert the company's logo, change the verbiage and fonts as needed. 

**For any transaction data field (those indicated by square brackets such as \[Closing Date\]), users cannot change the label; this will automatically populate with the data field from the transaction directly.  User must cut/paste these data fields as needed, copy will not work.**

Once user has customized the template as needed, they will save as a "**.dotx**" format. 

To do this, go to File / Save As and by default the location will be **This PC / Documents / Custom Office Templates**.  User should give this template a new name so it is easily identifiable. From the Save as type drop down select Word Template (\*.dotx) and Save.

Once saved as a ".dotx", in Commissions Online on the left navigation bar select **System Settings / Advanced Settings** / Templates tab and select \+ Add Custom Template.

For Contact specific letters such as Seller, Buyer, Attorney's, Cooperating Brokerage, etc., the letter will be generated from the Contacts tab of the transaction. Select the ellipsis to the far right of the contact, then Letter. 

**PLEASE NOTE: If there are multiple Sellers or Buyers attached to a transaction, the Attorney letters will only populate if the Attorney is attached to the first Seller or Buyer. As an alternative, you can attach the Attorney to all Sellers or Buyers.**
