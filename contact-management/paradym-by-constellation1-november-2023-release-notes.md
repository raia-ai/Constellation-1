Bug Fixes

1\. We fixed an issue with connecting to LinkedIn.   
Previously, when establishing a connection to LinkedIn, the user would be redirected back to the Social Connections page and the connection to LinkedIn would fail.   
Now, this issue has been resolved. 

2\. We fixed an issue with some scheduled blog posts disappearing without notice.   
Previously, in some cases when a blog post was scheduled to be published, it would unexpectedly disappear from the queue.   
Now, this issue has been resolved and scheduled posts will publish as expected.
