An "SEO" link has been added to the Listing Landing Page layout, which allows administrators to edit the Title, Page Header, and Meta Description for their Residential, Rental, Commercial, and Lots and Land listing landing pages.

City and Zip Listing Landing Pages with Zero Listings  
Recently we added a redirect to state landing pages with zero listings.   
Now, we’ve expanded our redirect functionality. Landing pages for states, cities, and zip codes that have no listings will now redirect users to the company's homepage.

Updated Listing Detail Fly-Out Page  
The Listing Detail fly-out page now displays parcel lines on the map by default, matching the functionality of the full Listing Detail Page.
