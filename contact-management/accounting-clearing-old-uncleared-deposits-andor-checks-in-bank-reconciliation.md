# Accounting - Clearing Old Uncleared Deposits and/or Checks in Bank Reconciliation

This purpose of this article is to show you how to create a journal entry to clear old uncleared checks and deposits.  

**The following instructions are only a suggestion and should be approved by your accountant.**

You may notice, while doing your bank reconciliation, there are many checks and/or deposits that have not cleared the bank.  There could be many reasons for this, perhaps it is a duplicate transaction, or a check was lost and never reached the recipient. If a check has not been cashed, you may want to reach out to the vendor and find out if they received the check and if not you will most likely want to [void the original check](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/knowledgeBase/14436250 "Voiding an AP Payment"), stop payment on that check, and issue a new check to the vendor. Even if the vendor said they received the check, but have not cashed it, your bank may no longer honor this check.  You should reach out to your bank to see what their policy is on this.

If there are just a few checks and/or deposits that have not cleared, you may have time to research each of these to find out if perhaps these are duplicate records or maybe you have voided a record and just need to find the offset to clear.  If time does not permit researching each individual record, another option may be to create a journal entry equal to the amount of the old uncleared records.  You will need to consult with your accountant to discuss what GL account to code the journal entry.  

**Note: This is just a suggestion and you should contact your accountant to see if they approve of this method.**

Below will outline the steps to take to clear old records with a journal entry.

*   After you have completed your bank reconciliation for the month, start a new bank reconciliation with the same end-of-month date to reconcile old uncleared checks/deposits. This bank reconciliation will only be used for clearing old checks that your bank will no longer honor. For example, if your bank will not honor checks older than 60 days and you have just completed your 05/31/2021 bank reconciliation, you may not want to leave uncleared checks prior to 04/01/2021 uncleared on your bank reconciliation.  Leaving old uncleared items on your bank reconciliation, that you know will never clear, gives an inaccurate account of how much cash you really do have on hand.
*   When starting this new bank reconciliation, enter 03/31/2021 in the “Clear through Date” field and click the “Mark Cleared by Date” button. 
*   This will put a check mark in the “Cleared?” column for all uncleared records prior to 04/01/2021. 
*   Enter the same amount as your “Prior Reconciled Balance” into the “New Bank Balance” field.
*   Enter an “as of” date equal to the “as of” date of your previous bank rec. 

At this time, you will show a “Difference” equal to the amount of all records prior to 04/01/2021. If the difference is represented by a negative value, you will need to create a journal entry that debits cash.  If the difference is a positive value, you will create a journal entry that credits cash. The offsetting GL code is determined by your accountant.  In this example, we are going to credit “Other Income” because I had a negative value as my difference. After I create my journal entry and retrieve it into my bank rec, and mark it as cleared, the “Difference” field is now zero.

Before I hit “Reconcile” I want to make certain to enter a meaningful note to describe that I am clearing out old unreconciled records. Hit “Reconcile” and you will now have only uncleared check records that will be honored by your bank. 

It is important to clear out old uncleared records regularly, to ensure an accurate reflection of funds available.

In my example, prior to clearing old stale records, my cash account balance as of 05/31/2021 was $1,021,192.44.

I have determined that the old uncleared items totaled $54,520.00, so I created a journal entry to account for this.

Note: After creating the journal entry, the balance in my cash account is $1,075,712.44; $54,520.00 more than what I had thought.
