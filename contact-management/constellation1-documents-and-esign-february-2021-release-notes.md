## Constellation1 rDocs

Searching For Transaction Tile

Constellation1 has updated the search feature on the Documents dashboard. When searching, the search results will persist on the dashboard, until you remove the search criteria. 

This will allow you to search for a transaction, navigate away from the dashboard, and upon your return, your search results will still be showing. 

To remove your search criteria, just click the “X” in the search box.

Searchable fields include:   
•    Contact names  
•    Property address   
•    Property MLS ID

Dashboard View Options

The dashboard view of Constellation1 Documents has options to view transactions as tiles or in a grid view. You can select your preferred view and set it as your default. 

View options are:   
•    Tile view

Setting the default view is quick and easy,

Improved Mobile Signing Session Workflow and Usability

Constellation1 has improved the mobile signing session workflow and usability. We have updated the user interface to improve readability to compel the font type and size to be consistent throughout the signing session. 

While in the signing session, the “Next” guide will scroll through the document showing the next field needing the signer’s attention. 

This workflow is consistent with the desktop view of a signature session. 

Form Fields Size Adjustments

Form Field tags have been updated to be adjustable. You can determine the size of the form field on a document. If the form field needs to cover multiple lines on a document, you can now drag out the corner for the form field to fit into the needed space on your form or document. 

The updated Form Field supports line breaks and carriage returns so formatting the text is easy and intuitive for the signer.

Attached Documents During Signing Session

During a signing session, there may be a requirement for a signer to add a document to the signature session. We have added the ability to allow a signer to upload needed documents to a signing session.

The use case can include if a signer is asked to upload a driver’s license, bank statement or other requested document. 

Adding documents to a signing session is easy. In the signing session, we have added an ‘Upload File’ button to the navigation. 

Clicking the button will open a new window or tab in the browser, allowing the signer to add documents.

Signing Groups

Constellation1 eSign has been updated to allow the creation of a signing group. Multiple signers can be added to the group. The group can be added to the signature session as a signer. When one of the members of the group completes the signature session, the signing session will progress to the next signer or group or will complete the signing session. 

The workflow:  
1\.    Create a group of signers in Constellation1 eSign.   
2\.    On creation of a signing session, add the group as a signer.  
3\.    The signing session is sent to all members of the group. The first person from the group, to complete the signing session will be signing on behalf of the group.   
4\.    The signing session will then move to the next phase of the signing session.   
a.    If they, are the last signer, then the session will complete.  
b.    If there are other signatures needed from the other parties, the session will move on to the other signers.  

Email Templates

We have given the email templates a facelift. You will notice a cleaner message and user interface in emails sent to admins and signers.
