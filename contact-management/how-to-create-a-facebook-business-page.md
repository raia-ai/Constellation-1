# How to Create a Facebook Business Page

**How to Create a Facebook Business Page** 

**The purpose of this article is the lay out the steps and requirements for creating a Facebook Business Page that can then be connected to your Paradym account.** 

**Overview:**  

**Step 1: Where to create a business page** 

**Step 2: Fill in basic information** 

**Step 3: Upload photos** 

**Step 4: Seeing your new page** 

**Step 5: Filling out detailed information** 

**Step 6: Growing your presence**

**Step 1:** Log into your personal Facebook account where you interact with friends and family as yourself. In the upper right corner, next to your image and name, is a plus sign.  Click that, and you will see a list appear in a drop-down menu.  Click on the fourth option down: Page.

**Step 2:** You will be taken to a new page, the majority of which is a large image you cannot interact with.  Turn your attention to the left side of the page, where there is a column requesting information. Fill out the page name field.   

For Category, start to type “real estate” and several options will populate; choose up to two.  

For Description, type out a short, one or two sentence summary of your general area and experience/investment in real estate.  Example: I am Bob Smith, real estate agent in the Tampa greater area, ready to help you find your new home! 

The “Create Page” button at the bottom of this column will know be filled in blue and is also now able to be clicked-on, which you should do.

**Step 3:** After clicking “Create Page” you will now see the column you are working in changes its title to “Set Up Your Page.”  Below are two fields you can click on to select a profile photo and cover photo from your computer’s hard drive.  The profile photo should be one of yourself, such as the one on your website or broker’s page for you. The cover photo should be a professional, neutral image that can convey your branding, location or a real estate theme in general. It should be different from your profile picture. Once you have those pictures chosen, click on “Save” at the bottom.

**Step 4:** You will now be on the landing page for your new Facebook Business Page.  You should see your profile photo and cover photo at the top of the page, and many other options below. The process to begin filling out the details of your page is easy to start.

**Step 5:** The resources to start filling in your page information such as contact number, email, website, hours and so on, can be accessed by looking down from your profile photo, to the section called **“Set Your Page up for Success.”**  You will notice the step for “Establish Your Page’s Identity” is already completed.  **“Provide Info and Preferences”** and **“Introduce Your Page”** still list steps left. 

Click on **“Provide Info and Preferences”** and Facebook will guide you through filling in the essential and preferred information your page should provide to the public.

**Step 6:** Once that is filled out, click on “**Introduce Your Page**,” and invite friends and family to your page.  Initially populating your page with familiar people as followers is the first step to growing a larger audience. 

Create a Welcome Post if you wish to highlight things about your profession and yourself. Facebook will provide you the means to attach photos and video as you see fit.
