# Creating Commission Deductions | Constellation1 Customer Hub

Deductions are fees that can be applied to a transaction and commission plans such as MLS fees, Errors and Omissions, Buyer/Seller Concession and other services.

If you are creating a Garnishment or Withholding type deduction, please refer to [Entering a Garnishment or Withholding](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/knowledgeBase/23638982)

**To add a new deduction:**

*   Select Commissions from left hand navigation bar
*   Select Deductions tab
*   Select the **Add+** button
*   Define the name of the deduction or fee
*   Define the payee, to whom the funds are paid
    *   Deductions can be treated as a withholding and remitted directly to a specific source for items such as IRS, Child support etc by selecting a Payee/contact search and selecting the payee from a contact in your list
*   Receivable account
    *   Where the funds are to be posted to in QuickBooks
*   Expense account
    *   Where funds offset expense in QuickBooks
*   Deductions can have a minimum and maximum established so that should your office request a certain amount be charged to the client and the agent collects an amount in excess of that amount, you can then Apply the excess deduction Value to the Agent Net
*   Deduction may be excluded from Company Dollar if desired
*   Should a deduction no longer be used, Active can be toggled OFF
*   If your brokerage is a BHHS Franchise and you wish to make this deduction exempt from Franchise Fee, toggle this on

When complete select **Save**
