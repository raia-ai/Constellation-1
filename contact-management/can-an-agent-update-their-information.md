# Can An Agent Update Their Information

An agent can update their information to appear on their Agent Profile Page through their Portal Manager. Items such as:

*   Photo
*   Contact Information
*   Biography

can be updated in Portal Manager and the changes will reflect on their profile page on LongandFoster.com once the BOI comes through. 

_Reminder: Changes made can take a few hours to appear as the BOI file must be received and processed._

If an agent is wanting to upload a new photo of themselves they can through their Portal Manager. Some information about adding a new photo:

*   The recommended size of the photo is 400px wide.
*   The image's size should be less than 1000kb - if it is larger then the size will be adjusted accordingly automatically.

**Flow of data:**

1 - Agent updates their information via portal

2 - that update triggers the data to be saved into the BOI file

3 - BOI file gets scheduled to be sent to RED

4 - RED receives BOI file and processes it

5 - if processed successfully update occurs on the website.

If issue always confirm that the information is making it into the BOI file first.
