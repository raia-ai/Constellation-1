2.  Click **Add** to create a new record.

## Type Field Descriptions

**Check** - This is referring to a check being written from the Trust account, not a check being deposited into the Trust account.  It is also used when funds are wired instead of issuing a check.  

**Deposit** - This is referring to a check that is written to your company and is deposited into your Trust account.  You may refer to this as "earnest money" or "hand money".  It is also used when funds are wired to you instead of a check being sent to you. 

**Promissory Note** - This is referring to a note only, not an actual transfer of cash; this will not affect your GL activity.

**Redemption** - This is referring to the redemption, turning in/over, of the promissory note; this will not affect your GL activity.
