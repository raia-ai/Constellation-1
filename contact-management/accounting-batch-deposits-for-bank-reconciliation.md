# Accounting - Batch Deposits for Bank Reconciliation

The purpose of this article is to show how to batch deposits prior to reconciling your cash accounts. 

Before starting your bank reconciliation, it can be helpful to batch deposits together, when you have deposited more than one check in a single deposit at the bank. Note: You do not have to batch your deposits in order to reconcile your cash accounts. If you choose not to batch deposits you will clear individual deposits instead of lump sum deposits. 

To batch deposits, navigate to **Bank > Processing > Batch Deposits**.

*   Select the **Cash Acct.** from the dropdown list

Batch deposits stay in the **Not Transferred** view until retrieved into the bank reconciliation.  Once deposits have been retrieved into the bank reconciliation, they will move to the **Transferred** view.

**Note: Editing a source transaction will not affect a deposit that is already in a batch. You must edit the batch by deleting the deposit and re-retrieve the corrected amount. Single d****eposits that have already been retrieved into the bank reconciliation cannot be included in a batch. You must delete the deposit from the bank reconciliation in order to include it in a batch.**
