*   Select the required entity **Type** from the dropdown menu.
*   Click the ellipsis "..." in the **Contact** column of the line item.
*   Select an existing contact from the currently existing list of contacts, or you can add a new contact through this listing.
*   The remaining fields for each Entity are optional.

An additional button can appear on the right hand side of an entity if you selected **Seller** or **Buyer** as a type that states "Set to primary Seller" or "Set to primary Buyer", respectively. Clicking this item will set that Entity as the seller or buyer in the main fields if there is more than one buyer or seller involved in the transaction.
