# Single Sign-On (SSO) Configuration | Constellation1 Customer Hub

Constellation1 Commissions Online provides the ability to use an existing Single Sign-On (SSO) third party account in our application. SSO is an authentication method that allows users to log in once with a single set of credentials to access multiple independent applications and websites, eliminating the need for repeated logins and multiple passwords.

If you are interested in this functionality, please contact us by emailing [commissions@constellation1.com](mailto:commissions@constellation1.com) and a member of our Team will be happy to assist.&#x20;

Once this additional add-on has been added to your account, from the left navigation bar, select System Settings / Advanced Settings and on the Advanced Settings tab you will see a new card, SSO Settings.&#x20;

We support both OIDC (OpenID Connect) and SAML 2.0 protocols and we will guide you using your third party SSO provider to ensure you are correctly configured.&#x20;

In addition, there is an option to provide a temporary account to new users for those integrated third party applications.&#x20;

When a new third party user accesses Commissions Online, the administrator will receive an email notification alerting them of the new account. In the Users module, the administrator can then upgrade the temporary account to a full Agent or Administrator account or delete it.
