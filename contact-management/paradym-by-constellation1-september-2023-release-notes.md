Bug Fixes   
1\. We fixed an issue with the weather app not working for property tours.   
Previously, the link in a tour to the property’s local weather was not working. Users would get an error message when they tried tapping the link.  
Now, this issue has been resolved. We’ve updated the weather app to WeatherAPI.com.
