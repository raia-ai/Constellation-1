### Constellation1 eSign

**ANCHOR TAGS** 

Anchor tags are specially formatted text, embedded into Word/Excel/PDF documents. These tags automate and define the location and role for signers in each signing session.  

Examples include:   
•    Signature   
•    Date fields  
•    Check boxes   
•    Radio buttons 

We have updated the anchor tags for consistent formatting, better configurability, and to allow for more ways to manage these areas on your documents. 

For more information about anchor tags and using tags on your document, please visit, [https://docs.constellation1.com/anchor-tags](https://docs.constellation1.com/anchor-tags) 

**Why did we do this?** Providing you with improved usability and more robust control over these fields.  
**Configuration:** This update has been made for all who are using the latest version of eSign.

  
**API UPDATES**  

For our customers who connect to Constellation1 eSign through our API, we have updated some of the parameters to control how the program opens and displays. 

The following have been added to control the launching of eSign:  
•    showLeftMenu   
•    cancelSession   
•    filterByTxName    
•    allowAddPackage   
•    allowApplyTemplate

**UI UPDATES** 

To improve the usability and provide a smooth user experience, we have updated the document preview panel. 

Updates include:  
•    Removing unnecessary scroll bars.   
•    Document Preview now extends to the bottom. Taking advantage of unused space in the preview column.   
•    Scroll the main document without scrolling other items on the page. The tool bar, preview thumbnails and left nav will remain in place.   
•    Left nav will collapse allowing for more room to display the document preview. 

**Why did we do this?** Improved workflow and a better user experience. 

**Configuration:** This update has been made for all who are using the latest version of eSign.
