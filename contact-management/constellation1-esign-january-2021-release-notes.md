**ANCHOR TAGS**&#x20;

Anchor tags are specially formatted text, embedded into Word/Excel/PDF documents. These tags automate and define the location and role for signers in each signing session. &#x20;

Examples include: \
•    Signature \
•    Date fields\
•    Check boxes \
•    Radio buttons&#x20;

We have updated the anchor tags for consistent formatting, better configurability, and to allow for more ways to manage these areas on your documents.&#x20;
