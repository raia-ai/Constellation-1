# Resetting Your Paradym Password | Constellation1 Customer Hub

We all forget a password from time to time.  The Paradym website makes it easy to reset your password 24 hours a day (sometimes even 25 hours a day if you time it right on the night we switch from Daylight Saving back to standard time).  Just follow these steps.  Note that the steps only work on accounts that have a permanent password set up.  If you have never logged in and set up a permanent password, then you must use the temporary password that was emailed to you when the account was set up.  Companies that set up their own agents can reset the temporary password using the information found in a separate article [HERE](https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/?TicketNumber=64361).

1. Go the the login page at [https://my.paradym.com/Login](https://my.paradym.com/Login) and click where it says Forgot Your Password?

2. Type in your username OR your email address, and click Reset My Password.

3. Assuming the website finds a match (more on what to do if it doesn't in a moment), it will tell you that it sent you an email with a verification code.

4. Check your email for a message that contains a verification code.

**BUT what if the website finds no match for my username or email address or displays some error message?**

If the website says that it "Could not find a single account with that username" then you might want to try some other email addresses that might be on your account.  If those do not match anything on the Paradym site, or you are seeing a more cryptic error, then you will need to contact your broker if your account was set up as part of your company's account, or contact the staff at Paradym if you acquired your own individual account.  The Paradym staff members are generally available from 9AM to 6PM Eastern time, M-F.
