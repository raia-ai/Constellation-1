*   Assign a name to your deduction.
*   If the funds are to be paid directly to the recipient such as the agent or a governing body, toggle on **Withholding.**
*   Select the **Payee** from the drop down list, the choices should be either **Agent** if being remitted to the agent or **Contact Search** if being remitted directly to an outside agency.
*   If it is being remitted to an outside agency, in the adjacent box do a search for the party and select them or add a new contact with a Contact Type of Miscellaneous to this account. 
*   For the Minimum and Maximum dollar amounts, you will configure those values in the deduction on the agent’s commission plan.
*   Apply Excess Deduction Value to would only be used if there was a Minimum and Maximum set and you wish to have the excess applied to **Agent Net** or **None**.
*   Exclude from Company Dollar is by default toggled **OFF** but if this Deduction should in any way affect the company dollar and should be excluded, be sure to toggle on.
*   If this is a Withholding, ensure that Withholding is toggled on.
*   Once the deduction has been created, you will then navigate to the Commission plan for the agent and add this new deduction to it.

**Note;** **If the Withholding or Garnishment is to be paid to a third party, it can only be added to the Commission Plan, not "on the fly" within a transaction.  In addition, if the Withholding or Garnishment is for one agent only, we strongly suggest that you create a brand new commission plan to attach this new deduction so that other agents using the same commission plan will NOT be affected.**
