Bug Fixes

1\. GPES-4775  
We fixed an issue with the mobile view that allowed some signer tags to display beyond the right edge of the page. 

Previously, in some cases, markups and signer tags could stretch or be placed beyond the right edge of the page causing the content of the tag to not show on the page.

Now, this issue has been resolved. Tags will remain within the page boundaries.
