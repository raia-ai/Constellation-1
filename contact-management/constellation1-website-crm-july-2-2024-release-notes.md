3\. Fixed an issue with state landing pages that return zero listings.&#x20;

Previously, in some cases, state landing pages may not display listings, due to the state being outside of a company’s service area.&#x20;

Now, State landing pages displaying zero listings will now be redirected to the company homepage.&#x20;

4\. Fixed an issue with custom form submission being marked as spam.\
Previously, when a custom form was completed and submitted, the system would identify the submission as spam, preventing the form details from being submitted.\
