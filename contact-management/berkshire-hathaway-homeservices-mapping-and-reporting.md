**Mapping your Transaction Types according to BHHS standards**

  * For each Transaction Type displayed, select the appropriate BHHS Transaction equivalent.&#x20;
  * If there are questions about which type to map them to, please consult with your BHHS administrative contact.
  * Once all the selections are made, select **Save** and this information will be retained and there is no need to revisit unless a new Transaction Type is added, or if the Franchise requests a change.
