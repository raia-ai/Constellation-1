Below are the steps in order to enter a Lease/Rental Transaction.  Entry of a Lease or Rental transaction is VERY similar to entry of a regular transaction with a few slight differences.

For reference purposes on entering transactions refer to the following links

[Constellation1 Commissions Online-Creating transactions via Transactions Wizard](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/knowledgeBase/15356015) if your Transaction Wizard is engaged

When entering a Rental or Lease transaction, the following terms are interchangeable

**Tenant = Buyer/Buying Side**

**Landlord = Seller/Selling Side**

When adding these contacts to your deal, ensure that when selecting the contacts, their type is appropriately selected similar to below as Tenant or Landlord.

**Please note:**

When the Transaction Wizard is engaged, by default the system will add the contacts as a **Buyer** or **Seller**.  They can then be edited in the transaction to reflect **Tenant** or **Landlord** after the fact.

In addition, if changing the contact type of Buyer or Seller, the system will only allow you to change it to a comparable type. ie. Buyer can **ONLY** be changed to Tenant or Seller can **ONLY** be changed to Landlord.  If you try to change one of these types to a NON-comparable type such as Miscellaneous, the system will throw an error similar to below
