**Facebook**&#x20;

**Step 1**:  Log into your Facebook account&#x20;

**Step 2:**  Go to your Facebook Business Page.  If you already know how to get to your Facebook Business Page, skip to step 4.  If you need assistance finding your Facebook business page, look to the left of your Facebook account when you are logged in.  You will have a list of options down the side of that page.  If you do not see Pages at the top, click the down arrow that says See More.  The items will be in alphabetical order.  Scroll down to Pages and click on it.  &#x20;
