##   
Website Release Details 

  
Agent Search

We’ve enhanced the agent service regions search functionality, by removing the character count limit. This change allows all cities within an agent's service region to be displayed during the search.

In our January release we announced the ability for consumers to search for agents based on services regions. 

When this functionality is enabled and configured, consumers can search for agents by their service regions. Those service regions will also display in the agent search results, agent profile page, in the agent tile of the office search results and on the agent website. 

[Click Here](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/knowledgeBase/25921890) for more details in the last release notes.

For more information about enabling and configuring this feature, please contact your Constellation1 representative. 

Property Photos  
We’ve updated the No Photo image to comply with DMCA copyright rules. For properties without a photo the new “No Unavailable” image will display.  

This update does not affect companies using a custom "No Photo" image.

Bug Fixes

**Website**

1\. We’ve fixed an issue that prevented users from successfully adding an office to an agent's account. This issue also prevented users from selecting an office on the Listing Roll-up Report. 

Previously, when trying to add an office to a user account, the popup modal would open a new browser tab with a blank page. Additionally, the offices were not available as a selection option when creating the Listing Rollup Report.

Now, this issue has been resolved. 

2\. We’ve fixed an issue that prevented agents and consumers from resetting their login password.

Previously, some agents and consumers were not able to reset their system password. Clicking the “Forgot Password” would result in an error.

Now, this issue has been resolved.

3\. We’ve fixed an issue that prevented some sold listings from appearing on an agent website. 

Previously, sold properties where the agent represented the buyer were not displayed in the “My Sold Listings” section on the agent website. 

Now, this issue has been resolved. Listings where the agent represents the buyer is limited to the past 24 months and will display on their website as expected.

4\. Fixed an issue with images failing to upload to an agents website. 

Previously, when agents attempted to upload images to their website, the image was not being uploaded to the system.

Now, this issue has been resolved.
