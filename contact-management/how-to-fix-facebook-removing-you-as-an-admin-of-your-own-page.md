# How to Fix Facebook Removing You As an Admin of Your Own Page

**This is for a new Facebook bug as of February 2024, which has resulted in many users being removed as the admin of their own business page. If this applies to you, read on for our suggested fix.**

Here are the steps that \*\*MAY\*\* fix your issue. If Meta has indeed removed you as the admin for your own page, that’s why you can’t connect/reconnect a Meta site to us.

You want to add someone you trust (friend, family) as an Admin on your Facebook business page.&#x20;

To do that, go and sign in/switch to your Facebook business page and then hit **Settings on the left.**&#x20;

Then click on Facebook Pages Experience (on the left of Settings) and then "Add New" the right beside "People with Facebook Access" which, if empty, means Facebook lost your admin rights to your OWN PAGE.&#x20;

Search up the individual you trust and then add them as an admin (Ensure he has full rights before sending the invite).

They will then get the notification on Facebook and will need to accept the invite.&#x20;

From here they will need to follow the **exact same steps you did** when they add **you** as an admin.&#x20;

From here, you **should** be able to connect your Facebook/Instagram.
