This article details the steps required to configure your company profile within Constellation1 Commissions Online.

By default, your company profile will be created for you when the database is created.  If you need to edit your company profile such as a name change, address change etc. navigate to System Settings / Company

A screen similar to the following will appear, where you can update the Company Name, Email, Address, City, etc.&#x20;

_**Note: The State/Province (Canadian and United States and Turks and Caicos, customers ONLY) selected will auto-populate in new transactions (manually entered or via Transaction Wizard), listings, agents, offices, users and contacts and can be edited if needed.**_&#x20;

You can enter a value for your Annual Goal ($) which will update the Company Income Widget on the Dashboard. It will display the current percentage that has been counted towards meeting this goal.

Your Franchise Designation will be noted in the Company profile as well.  If there is a change to your Franchise Designation status, either becoming part of or being removed from a specific franchise, select the appropriate Franchise name from the list or select Independent should you no longer belong to a Franchise.

Once all changes are made, select Save.
