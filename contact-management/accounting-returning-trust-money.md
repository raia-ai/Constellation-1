# Accounting - Returning Trust Money

This article outlines the steps to manually issue a trust check.

Occasionally sale transactions will fail, or you may be holding earnest money in excess of the amount required to equal the gross revenue on the sale, and you will need to return earnest money to the buyer or another party.  When this happens, you will need to manually create a check record. 

To manually create a check record, navigate to **Sales > Processing > Trust Transactions**, then follow these steps:

*   Filter for the trust record and click **Edit**
*   Click the green plus sign and select **Check** from the **Type** drop-down
*   Do not enter **Date Paid** or **Check #**
    *   Note:  These fields will auto-populate at the completion of the check run
*   Enter the required **Amount**
*   Select the **Payer/Payee** by clicking the green plus sign, to bring up the **Contacts** pop-up
*   **Filter** for the contact or click **Add** to create a new contact record as needed
*   After contact selection is made, click **OK**
*   Select **Resource Type** from the dropdown
*   The **Comment**, **Check Address**, and **Check City/State Zip** fields are optional 
    *   Note:  If you enter the address, the address will appear on the check and will display in your windowed envelopes
*   Click **Save**

To print the check go to **Sales > Processing > Issue Trust Checks.** 

*   Select the **Trust Cash Account** from the drop-down
*   **First Check Number** will default but can be overwritten
*   In the **Select** column put a checkmark next to the check or checks you want to print

*   Click **Pre-Check Report** and print if you would like a hard copy
*   Click **Print Checks**
*   Click **Finish Processing**, if the check printed successfully

Note:  You may click **Reset** any time prior to clicking **Finish Processing**, if you do not want to complete the check run.
