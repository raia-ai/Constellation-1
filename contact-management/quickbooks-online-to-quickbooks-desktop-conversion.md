# QuickBooks® Online to QuickBooks Desktop® Conversion

This article outlines the data sets that can be migrated from QuickBooks® Online (QBO) to Desktop (QBD). Almost all data points important to the financials can be migrated from the Online account(s) to QuickBooks® Desktop for U.S. Users ONLY.

_Please note that QuickBooks® Online does not provide a utility to migrate in Canada._  

When exports are performed, we run the financial reports for the prior month, month to day, and prior year and to ensure a match or correct any items causing them to be out of balance inclusive of the following:

*   All transactions, names, and other data
*   Chart of Accounts
*   Products and Services (Inventory), Vendors, Customers, Employees
*   Payment Methods (with field length limits and exceptions mentioned below)

*   All transactions with any value

The following items are not exported:

*   Company Information and preferences: must be re-entered.
*   Reconcile reports and reconciliations are not exported. We ensure last reconciliation is redone
*   Companies using Multicurrency can be migrated however it is a more involved project
*   Paychecks exported as checks; pay period not exported. If using enhanced payroll, YTD payroll will require reentry. Recommended our staff manage this as can have adverse effects for payroll reporting
