Click the widget to navigate to the Income & Goals page, which displays the company’s income and goals in detail. Filters at the top of the page allow the user to refine income and goal details by broker, group, city, state, and date range.  
These details include:

*   Annual goal
*   Year-to-date income
*   Percentage of goals met, year to date
*   Plus or minus (+/-) income, year to date
*   Projected annual income

Add, Edit, or Deactivate Enterprise Insights Users   
We’ve added the ability to add, edit, and deactivate Enterprise Insights users.   
In the Users module, we’ve added an Add + button to the top-right corner to allow administrators to add new Enterprise Insights users. To edit or deactivate users, administrators can now select the Action Menu (⋯) for the user and click Edit or Deactivate.

My Workspace Updates  
In our last release, we introduced My Workspace. In this release, we’ve made some significant updates to enhance its features and functionality.   
On the My Workspace Dashboard, we’ve made certain items clickable so related details are easier to access. Additionally, filters have been added to the top of each section.  

**Upcoming Closings**  
We’ve added more details about upcoming closings to the top of the Upcoming Closings section and filters to give users more control over what information is displayed. Users can use the Upcoming dropdown to filter by date and view what transactions are coming up in the next 7 to 30 days. The Overdue dropdown allows users to filter by overdue items.

Click the property address to open the Details page of the transaction. 

  
**Conditions Due**  
Click the property address to go to the conditions section on the Details page of the transaction, where conditions can be added, edited, or deleted. 

  
**Agent License Expiration Date**   
Click the agent’s name to view their Details page, their license information and expiration date, which are listed under Additional Details. The license expiration date calendar will  open by default and allow the user to update the license expiration date more easily.

New! Easy Access to Commissions Online Help  
We’ve added a Help icon to the top-right corner of the page that users can click to open a summary of the module and easily access links to more detailed support resources.

Dashboard Widget Dollar Values  
We’ve updated the behavior of the dollar values on the Dashboard widgets. To save space, the values displayed on the widgets are rounded. Now, when the user hovers their cursor over the number, a tooltip will display the actual, unrounded dollar value.

Added Address to Deposits Held By Dropdown  
We’ve updated the Held By dropdown for Deposits to include the brokerage or contact’s address, when available.   
In the Details tab for a transaction, under Deposits, when using the Held By dropdown to select the brokerage/office that is holding the deposit, the address will now also display along with the name to allow the user to confirm they are selecting the correct entity, especially when a brokerage has multiple offices with the same name.

Statement Delivery Templates  
We’ve updated the Template Type field in the Statement Delivery options to show customized templates at the top of the list.   
In the Commission tab for a transaction, when the user clicks Action Menu > Statement Delivery, the template type list will now display customized templates at the top of the list. If there is more than one, customized templates will sort in alphabetical order, followed by standard templates in alphabetical order.

Adding Commissions Rules to Transactions  
We’ve made it easier for administrators to create and add new commission rules to an existing transaction.  
In the Commissions tab for a transaction, under Commission Details, we’ve updated the Commission Rule dropdown and added the option to create a new commission rule that can be applied to the transaction and available for future transactions. Simply click the + Create New Commission Rule option at the bottom of the dropdown and follow the usual rule creation flow.

![](https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/Wiki/WikiDocs/2472652/images/KB-ReleaseNotes/Commissions/2023/12%20Dec/2023-Commissions-Nov-CommissionRule.png)

Contacts –First Names Limited to 25 Characters  
We’ve updated the character limit for a contact’s first name to 25 characters to match that used in QuickBooks®.  
This applies to contacts added to the master contact list or to a specific transaction. 

New Contact Types Added  
We’ve added two new categories to the Contact Type dropdown: Landlord and Tenant.

![](https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/Wiki/WikiDocs/2472652/images/KB-ReleaseNotes/Commissions/2023/12%20Dec/2023-Commissions-Nov-ContactType.png)

  
 Note that when using the Transaction Wizard to create a transaction, existing contacts will be added to the transaction as either buyer or seller. To change the contact type, the contact will need to be removed and re-added to the transaction with the correct label.  

Master Templates   
In the October release, we announced the addition of new attorney letters to the master templates.   
In this release, we’ve added the full address and phone number of the seller and buyer on the following master letter templates:

*   Selling Broker Letter
*   Seller’s Attorney Letter
*   Buyer’s Attorney Letter

Agent Expenses   
We’ve updated the Expenses tab in the Agent profile to display invoices in chronological order from oldest to newest. Invoice details will be collapsed by default, but the user can click the arrow on the left of the row to view more information about each invoice.

New Agent Incentive Level Report Filter  
We’ve added the option to include inactive agents in the Agent Incentive Level Report.   
In the Agent Incentive Level Report, under Advanced Filters, we’ve added an Inactive Agents dropdown where the user can opt to include or exclude them from the report. The default setting is to exclude them.

Canadian Tax Setting Updates  
We’ve added a Tax Year dropdown option to the Commissions tab of a transaction for our users in Canada.  
When the Enable Tax option is turned on in Advanced Settings, a Tax Year dropdown will now appear in the Commission tab of a transaction in the agent details section. 

![](https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/Wiki/WikiDocs/2472652/images/KB-ReleaseNotes/Commissions/2023/12%20Dec/2023-Commissions-Nov-RepportAgentCommDetail.png)

   
This dropdown allows the agent to select which tax year the commission income will be applied to. If they select the next tax year, the commission income for that transaction will be applied to the following tax year.   
Additionally, there will be a new toggle in the Transaction Commission Detail Report called Using for T4A validation. When enabled, the Tax Year dropdown will become available in the filters for the report, so the user can select a specific tax year for the report.

![](https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/Wiki/WikiDocs/2472652/images/KB-ReleaseNotes/Commissions/2023/12%20Dec/2023-Commissions-Nov-RepportTaxYear1.png)

   
The report will show all closed transactions from the selected tax year.  
By default, the report will use the process date as the tax year unless it is overridden by selecting the tax year as described above.

Bug Fixes

1\. We fixed an issue with generating a Transaction Record Sheet on buy side transactions that have a deposit.   
Previously, with a buy side transaction that has a trust deposit, the user would receive an error message when generating a Transaction Record Sheet.  
Now, this issue has been resolved. Users will be able to generate a Transaction Record Sheet for all transactions. 

2\. We fixed an issue with users receiving an error when generating customized versions of the Transaction Record Sheet.  
Previously, when a Transaction Record Sheet was customized by having some fields removed, users were unable to generate the report and would receive an error that said, “Value can not be null”.  
Now, this issue has been resolved. 

3\. We fixed an issue with the Transaction Record Sheet displaying the incorrect agent amounts when the agent represented both sides of a transaction.  
Previously, when an agent represented the buying and selling sides of a transaction, the Transaction Record Sheet would show incorrect amounts for the agent in the Payables section.  
Now, this issue has been resolved. 

4\. We fixed an issue with the Commission Income Profit & Loss Report showing incorrect values when reported in QuickBooks®.   
Previously, the Commission Income Profit & Loss Report in QuickBooks® did not show the correct numbers when there were no withholding's associated with the transaction.   
Now, this issue has been resolved. 

5\. We fixed an issue with setting a transaction’s transaction group to Other.   
Previously, when a transaction’s transaction group was set to Other, the user would receive a confirmation that the setting had successfully saved. However, when going back to the transaction, the transaction group would revert to the previously saved setting.   
Now, this issue has been resolved and we have removed Other as an option from the transaction groups. 

6\. We fixed an issue with the Commission Receivables field not showing on the Commission tab.    
Previously, in a specific use case where a commission was being disbursed by a third party, the Commission Receivables field would not display in the Commission tab of a buy side transaction.   
Now, this issue has been resolved.

7\. We fixed an issue with sellers not being added to listings.   
Previously, when creating a new listing with new sellers, the system would not respond or go to the next step.  
Now, this issue has been resolved.
