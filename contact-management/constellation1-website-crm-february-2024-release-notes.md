## BUG FIXES

**Website**

1\. Fixed an issue with links in blogs that are shared on Facebook not working. \
Previously, when a website blog post was shared on Facebook in some cases the links in the shared post did not work.\
Now, this issue has been resolved.&#x20;

2\. Fixed an issue with sharing a Market Trend report through email not working\
Previously, when a user tried to share a Market Trend report by selecting the email option, the email as not being sent. \
Now, this issue has been resolved.&#x20;

3\. We fixed an issue with public records and landing pages with /realestate/ in the URL now opening. \
Previously, when a public records page, city landing page or listing landing page had /realestate/ as part of the URL the page would not open. \
Now, pages with /realestate/ in the URL will open as expected.&#x20;

4\. We fixed and issue with the website rotating title tags. \
Previously, when rotating title tags were set up, the title tags were not being updated every month. \
Now, when rotating title tags are configured and enabled, the titles will automatically change every 30 days as expected.&#x20;

## Technology Updates&#x20;

**CRM**

1\. We have optimized the CRM's performance, improving navigation and page load speeds.

**CRM Mobile App**
