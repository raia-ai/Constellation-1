**Topic**: Recommended Property Emails FAQ

**A**: Emails are sent from the owner of the client.   For emails sent from an agent, we will attempt to send from the agent’s primary email address. This is the email address shown on the agent website.   If we're not allowed to send from the agent email address, the system will send from the default, [rdeskcrm@rdesk.com](mailto:rdeskcrm@rdesk.com). Emails sent from the company, we will attempt to send from the company email address that is on file in the CRM database. If we're not allowed to send from the company email address, the system will send from the default, [rdeskcrm@rdesk.com](mailto:rdeskcrm@rdesk.com). The Reply To address will link back to the sender. The Reply To for agents will be the agent's primary email address. The Reply To for company emails will be the company BR Email address.  Having an SPF file with your email host will help us send emails from your address. Contact your Constellation1 representative for details about the SPF file.
