## FAQ 3

**Topic**: Visual Tours & YouTube

**Q**: I don't have a YouTube channel connected. Why do I have a Tour Video option then?

**A**: If your account was created under your brokerages account, they more than likely have their own YouTube channel connected and have your tour uploaded to it.  **This leads to a follow up question for the inquiry above.    Q:** The Tour Video shows an outdated version of my tour. How can this be fixed?   **A:** You will need to get in contact with your broker or admin to have them update it from the broker account.  Now, let's back up a little bit.

## FAQ 4

**Topic**: Visual Tours & YouTube

**Q**: What if you do have your own YouTube channel connected, and your Tour Video option is showing your outdated version of the tour?

**A**: You have to update the YouTube video.     **NOTE:** This is the only place that you will need to update your tour as all other sites it goes to are considered Live Links, while the YouTube video is an actual upload.

## FAQ 5

**Topic**: Visual Tours & YouTube

**Q**: So, how do I refresh the YouTube Video (Tour Video) to reflect the changes I've made?

**A**: While on the page from the photo above, scroll down on the left-hand column until you locate social media icons inside of circles as shown below. Click on the one for YouTube.   ![](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/api/attachments/image/2472652/feb08728-d87c-4872-a768-1c01977c871a.png) When you click on the YouTube icon, the follow photo below shows what screen appears next.   ![](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/api/attachments/image/2472652/16e129d3-d79a-40b0-90a2-cbdd299f7fb2.png) This will show the original date this version was posted, along with a View and Repost option.    **View** takes you to the YouTube video on the YouTube website.    **Repost** is the button you choose when you need to re-upload your tour to YouTube.  **NOTE:** If the tour has been posted to YouTube previously and the old upload needs to be removed, a check box is provided to allow that to be done. **Once the box is checked**, then you can hit **Post Now**.  Once you hit Post Now, you will see the following window.    ![](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/api/attachments/image/2472652/389824f7-9bc1-464d-bf85-9a9f2c61cac6.png)   This can take up to several minutes depending on how many photos are in the tour.    If you wish to check the status of your upload, you can click on **Social Media Campaign** on the left-column.   ![](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/api/attachments/image/2472652/6033b47f-e6e3-4f8f-bb5e-e2118ba06985.png) **Social Media** **Campaign** will show you a list of all shares of this tour to what social sites, when, and what time. You will notice that the YouTube upload is likely saying **Pending.    NOTE:** This does not mean the listing is pending. Only the upload to YouTube. If everything is going through fine, and you refresh the page, the next item should say Processing, followed by Rendering, then Uploading.    Once the upload it complete, the verbiage below the photo will disappear. You will be able to preview the YouTube video now.
