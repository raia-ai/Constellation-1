## FAQ 8

**Topic**: Market Snapshot FAQ’s

**Q**: Can I Print a Market Snapshot?

This means we can determine when the consumer viewed the Snapshot and display that information for you.

## FAQ 12

**Topic**: Market Snapshot FAQ’s

The Market Snapshot gives the consumer an overview of their neighborhood, but they still need the expert analysis of a real estate professional to get an accurate idea of the value of their home if they are planning to sell. The best thing to do is to contact the lead and determine if an HMR or a CMA is required.
