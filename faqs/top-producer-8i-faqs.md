## FAQ 19

**Topic**: Listing Alerts FAQ

**Q**: Can I send a daily summary email instead of sending up-to-the-minute alerts as they happen?

**A**: Yes, if you prefer sending alerts once a day, you can send a summary email that contains all of the market activity for the last 24 hours. The summary email looks like this: ![](https://na3.files.teamsupport.com/TSData/WikiDocs/2472652/images/TopProducer%20-%20Wiki%20KB%20images/LAFAQs/LA%20FAQ%202.png)  And if they click to see more details, they’ll see this landing page: ![](https://na3.files.teamsupport.com/TSData/WikiDocs/2472652/images/TopProducer%20-%20Wiki%20KB%20images/LAFAQs/LA%20FAQ%203.png)  For details on how to send alerts once a day, see the next FAQ.

## FAQ 22

**Topic**: Listing Alerts FAQ

**Q**: What listing changes will they be notified of, and what listing details will they be able to see?

**A**: Whenever a new listing comes on the market, an existing listing’s price changes, or a listing is sold, the client will be notified (only if a listing matches what they’re looking for, of course). If they click in the initial email to see more details, they’ll see lots of info, including complete property details, a street view, schools in the catchment area, and a comparison of the home against averages in the zip code.

## FAQ 23

**Topic**: Listing Alerts FAQ

**Q**: Can I just send listing alerts to my clients, or do they have to receive a Market Snapshot too?

## FAQ 24

**Topic**: Listing Alerts FAQ

**Q**: Can my clients stop receiving listing alerts if they want to?

## FAQ 25

**Topic**: Listing Alerts FAQ

**Q**: How do you know which listings to send? I want to make sure my clients are only receiving details that are relevant.

**A**: We look at the criteria you entered when you created their Market Snapshot. This criteria includes the zip code, price, property type and the number of bedrooms/bathrooms. We’ll only send alerts for listings that match this criteria.

## FAQ 27

**Topic**: Listing Alerts FAQ

**Q**: I don't want to send listing alerts to my clients. How do I stop them?

**A**: To stop sending listing alerts to a client, stop the Market Snapshot report that is generating them. Go to the Market Snapshot tab of a contact record in [Top Producer® X CRM](https://crm.topproducer.com/) and click **Stop** next to the report. You can then create a new report for the client with different listing alert settings. And if you don’t want to send alerts for future snapshots, just go to **Settings > Market Snapshot** > then clear the alerts in the _Listing Alert Settings_ section. Any future snapshots you create will have listing alerts turned off by default. ![](https://na3.files.teamsupport.com/TSData/WikiDocs/2472652/images/TopProducer%20-%20Wiki%20KB%20images/LAFAQs/LA%20FAQ%208.png)

## FAQ 28

**Topic**: Listing Alerts FAQ

**Q**: How long will it take for them to receive the alert once a listing changes?

**A**: If you’ve selected to send a summary email instead of up-to-the-minute alerts, obviously they’ll receive one email every 24 hours.   If you’ve selected to send alerts as they happen, we do our best to send new listing or price change alerts immediately. The longest it’ll take would be about 30 minutes. Sold alerts are dependent on two things—your MLS and how quickly the agent updates it in the MLS. Most alerts are sent immediately, just like the new listing/price change alerts. However, there are some cases where we don’t immediately get notified when a property is sold.  We try to keep that duration to a minimum, but it can vary from a few hours to a couple of days. Again, this is dependent on your MLS and most alerts are immediate!

## FAQ 29

**Topic**: Listing Alerts FAQ

**Q**: Who will the alert appear to be from?

**A**: You! The From field in the listing alert emails display the email address you entered in your account (**Settings** > My Information). And of course your picture and contact information appear in every alert we send.

## FAQ 30

**Topic**: Listing Alerts FAQ

**Q**: Can I see how many alerts I'm sending and how many are being viewed?

**A**: Yes! Each week we’ll send you a summary report that details how many alerts and snapshots you’ve sent and how many of your clients have viewed them. We’ll automatically send it to the email address you entered in your Agent Profile so you don’t have to do a thing.

**Source**: https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/knowledgeBase/28563116

## FAQ 31

**Topic**: Listing Alerts FAQ

**Q**: Can I view the Listing Alerts that have been sent to a contact and whether they've opened them?

**A**: You’ll be able to view all the Listing Alert events from the _Notifications_ tab in the [Top Producer® 8i CRM](https://www.topproducer8i.com/) contact record. Click any of the links to see the alerts you sent. ![](https://na3.files.teamsupport.com/TSData/WikiDocs/2472652/images/TopProducer%20-%20Wiki%20KB%20images/LAFAQs/LA%20FAQ%209.png)
