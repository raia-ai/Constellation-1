# Setting up a Bonus or Manager Override

The **Manager Override** feature allows you to assign a bonus to a “Manager” as a recruiting or other type of payment. Manager Overrides are calculated on an "end" basis.  We support an unlimited number of Manager Overrides.

_\*Each Manager configured will receive a check through the transactions closing.\*_

*   Begin by navigating to the Bonus tab on the Agent that is paying the Manager or Bonus.
*   You must be in Edit and next check the new button to the right of Manager Overrides & Recruiting Bonus.
*   The resource will be "I" Agents.
*   Using the magnifying glass icon to select the agent or manager.

*   You can select how this should calculate based on the following options: Agent Portion, Gross, Adjusted Gross and Broker Portion. 
*    Deductions can be based on the following types: Broker Portion or Agent Portion.  
*   Once assigned to an Agent, the “Manager” will receive a payment – the calculation of which is based on a portion of the Agent’s net commission at closing (after all other applicable fees/deductions) - consisting of a percentage, a flat dollar amount or both.
*   These values are represented on the right side  Agent Detail window.
*   If the Apply Max. Cap is checked, this will ensure that any values will stop at the amount entered in the Amount field using the Anniversary dates as the criteria for the calculation, meaning if the closing date of the transaction does not fall into the anniversary start and end dates, the calculation will not occur. 
*   The Amt to Date field will display the cumulative amounts collected using the same date criteria as described above.

_**\*A few additional notes about Manager Overrides\***_

The Manager Override will be displayed on both the D1 format of the Transaction Record Sheet, Review Closing and applicable reports.  If an agent has double-ended a transaction with a Manager Override assigned, the Manager'scheck/ cheque will combine the values from each end into one checks/cheque for the selected Manager Override.

If the Manager's Override exceeds the broker's portion of the particular transaction, you will presented with the following warning when you try to close the transaction: ““The Manager Override that you are trying to pay exceeds the Broker portion on this transaction, please manually override and adjust the amounts accordingly”  

Override amounts do NOT increase the gross commission of a “Manager” and do NOT affect the gross commission of Agents. They do, however, reduce the Company or Agent portion of commission.  

**The Manager Override amounts should be reported as Other Income for T4A purposes.**

**Manager’s Override in QuickBooks®**

*   Use of the Manager Override will generate a check/cheque payable to the Manager as selected on the commission tab of the Agent.
*   The check/cheque will be issued from the Pay Manager from Bank account entered on the GL Accounts tab of the Company Profile.

**General Ledger Accounts Affected when using the Manager's Override:**
