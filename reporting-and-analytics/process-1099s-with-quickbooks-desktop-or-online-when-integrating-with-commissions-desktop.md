# Process 1099's with QuickBooks® Desktop or Online when Integrating with Commissions Desktop

In January 2022, the Internal Revenue Service made changes to both 1099-MISC and 1099-NEC requirements. Details related to these changes implemented by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) can be viewed via [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1099mec.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1099mec.pdf "Instructions for Forms 1099-MISC and 1099-NEC")

**1099’s will be generated in QuickBooks®**

*   We recommend confirming values recorded on the 1099-NEC form by using the Transaction Commission/Fee/Sales Report via Reports / Transaction Reports
*   Please configure the report as noted below:
    *   Date Type = Process Date
    *   Report Type = Detail
    *   From Date = January 1 for the previous calendar year
    *   To Date = December 31 for the previous calendar year
    *   Include Closed should be checked

_Tax Year Option should be changed via the Additional Options panel if there are Agents who deferred commission to another tax year and select Page Break Between Agents so users can provide the report along with the 1099-NEC._

_**Please note: The 1099-NEC form to report Non-Employee Compensation is included in both QuickBooks® Online and Desktop versions however, Intuit only supports versions issued during the last 3 years:**_
