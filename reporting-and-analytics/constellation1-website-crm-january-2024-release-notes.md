The new limit will allow knowledgeable customers to customize their robot.txt file. The file is located in the website admin under System Variables.

Note: Constellation1 maintains and updates the robot.txt file as needed to prevent malicious bots from crawling the websites and to improve website SEO. Any customization's to this file are the responsibility of the user.&#x20;

BUG FIXES\
**Website**\
1\. Fixed an issue with the content editor not showing all editing tools on the menu bar.

Previously, on the menu bar of the content editor, there was an icon allowing the user to expand the menu bar to show more editing tools when creating or editing content.

Now, this issue has been resolved. Clicking the last icon on the menu bar will open or close the expanded tools menu.&#x20;

2\. We fixed an issue with the Commute Time feature not returning listings in the search results.&#x20;

Previously, when a consumer added a criteria to the Commute Time feature in the More Options section of the property search, the search would not return listings in the results.

Now, this issue has been resolved and the property search will return listings that match the search criteria in the results.&#x20;

3\. We fixed an issue with fields on the property editor being too small and not show the content in the field.&#x20;

Previously, some fields on the property editor were too small to see the content that had been entered.

Now, this issue has been resolved. The page layout has been updated to allow all fields to display in a standard layout allowing the field information to display as expected.&#x20;

4\. We fixed an issue with the sold price on recently sold listings showing as same number as the list price on the Market Trend report.&#x20;

Previously, the sold price of listings on the market trend report did not show the correct price and would default to show the listing price.

Now, this issue has been corrected, the list and sold prices for recently sold properties will show the correct numbers.
