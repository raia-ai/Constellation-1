# Accounting - Third-party 1099s in Sales Transactions

The purpose of this article is to provide information for the purpose of the 1099 Form dropdown on the Third-party tab of sale transactions.

In instances where you are required to distribute 1099's to outside brokers, when they are paid at the closing by a third-party, follow the steps below to ensure a 1099 is created for the outside broker:

*   Navigate to the **Third-party** tab of the sale.
*   Click the green plus sign to add a negative pass-through record, equal to the amount paid out at closing.
*   Check the **Pass-through?** box. 
    *   When you check the **Pass-through?** box, you will receive a pop-up that notifies you that the **Pay by AP?** box will be unchecked when you click **OK**.
*   Click **OK** on the pop-up.
