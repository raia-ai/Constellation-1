# Process T4As when Integrating with Commissions Desktop

The purpose of this article is to provide the information to Process T4A's.

**Prior to processing T4A’s we strongly recommend all mandatory information is entered correctly:**

* Each Agent should be configured with their correct legal name and Social Insurance Number/Business Number. If this information is missing the application will display a warning "There is an invalid SIN or Payroll number for affected Agents. Please go to the Agent profile to correct them first."  Agents will also require the usual mandatory information such as a complete address, province and postal code.&#x20;
* We recommend confirming values recorded on the T4A form by using the Transaction Commission/Fee/Sales report via Reports / Transaction Reports
* Please configure the report as noted below:
  * Date Type = Process Date
  * Report Type = Detail
  * From Date = January 1 for the previous calendar year
  * To Date = December 31 for the previous calendar year
  * Include Closed should be checked&#x20;

_Tax Year Option should be changed via the Additional Options panel if there are Agents who deferred commission to another tax year and select Page Break Between Agents so users can provide the report along with the T4A._

_If you have entered any history for Agents that have changed their registration to transact as a Personal Real Estate Corporation, please ensure you select Actual Commissions. This will eliminate any history that may have been entered to capture commissions earned as an individual vs a Personal Real Estate Corporation towards existing commission plan mid-calendar year. The reported amount may require adjustments (+/-) to the T4A amounts when reviewing as described below._&#x20;

**NOTE: Effective Tax Year 2023, Box 015 is only mandatory if there is an amount in Box 016. Here is the link from Canada Revenue Agency site;** [**https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/completing-filing-information-returns/t4a-information-payers/t4a-slip.html**](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/completing-filing-information-returns/t4a-information-payers/t4a-slip.html)
