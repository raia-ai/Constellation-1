# Creating a Partial Payment Commission Plan

A Partial Payment Commission Calculation means users can allocate Broker Flat Fees and Other Fees to partial payment transactions (20125613A, 20125613B, etc.) that will allow the user to pre-define specific Fee amounts that do not use the existing proportional calculations. 

Sample Partial Payment Commission plan:

*   In the sample above, Partial Payment Transaction A will deduct 10% + $500.00 as the Broker Portion, Partial Payment B will deduct 10% + $250.00 as the Broker Portion and so on... until the total commission receivable is equal to 90% + 1200.00, which would be represented by five (5) partial payment transactions.
*   Enter the percentage value by entering value in Main Transaction - Total Commission field. This value must be the same for all levels of the commission plans and once you enter the required value in the Main Transaction -Total Commission percent column, the 1-12 percentage fields will auto-populate with the same percentage and become locked.
*   Flat Fee is defined by the user on each line; total of each will appear in the Main Transaction – Total Commission (Flat) line.
*   Users will assign the “Partial Payment” commission plan to the “Main” partial payment transaction once the first payment has been created
*   The TOTAL Broker Flat Fee expected to be paid in subsequent A,B,C transactions will adhere to current “Forced Validation” flag and logic.
*   Users will assign the “Partial Payment” commission plan to the “Main” partial payment transaction.
*   The TOTAL Broker Flat Fee expected to be paid in subsequent A,B,C transactions will adhere to current “Forced Validation” flag and logic.
*   When users enter A, B & C transactions, the corresponding Fee(s) 1, 2, & 3 from the commission plan will populate the commission detail window accordingly.
*   You will ONLY be able to override the commission plan with this type of partial payment transaction, otherwise C1 Commissions does not allow for this functionality.
*   You will be able to change the partial payment type commission plan on the main Transaction once it has been selected and has at least one Partial Payment Transaction created.
*   Some additional notes relating to Partial Payment type commission plans:

    *   Up to $
    *   And/Or
    *   End
