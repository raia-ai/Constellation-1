# Accounting - Office Selection in Agent Commissions

The purpose of this article is to provide information regarding the use of the **Office** dropdown in the **Agent Commission** section of the **Commission** tab of **Sale Transactions**.

If you have agents that work for multiple offices, and you want to keep GL activity separate for each office, you may think the only way to accomplish this is to enter a separate agent profile for each of the agent’s offices.  This method will provide what you need; however, this method requires a purchased license for each of these records.  A more cost effective way to accomplish the same thing is to use the **Office** dropdown in the **Agent Commission** section of the **Commission** tab of the **Sale Transaction**.

Here’s how it works:

When an agent is added to a sale transaction, the **Office** field will populate with the agent’s default office, assigned in the agent’s profile record.  In the example below, the agent’s default office is H: Hudson.

With office H:Hudson selected, below is how the agent’s portion of the sale will be accounted for in the GL:

In the example below, the agent with a default office H:Hudson, has a sale that needs to be accounted for in the S:Salem office.  In this instance, S:Salem should be selected from the **Office** dropdown:

With office S:Salem selected, see below for how the agent’s portion of the sale will be accounted for in the GL:

Changing the agent’s office in the sale transaction will also ensure that all of the agent’s sale reports will report the correct office. 

Using the two sale scenarios above, see below how the sales activity will be reported for the agent:

Note:  If you closed a sale, with the wrong office referenced in the sale, you are able to change the office in the agent’s commission as long as the transaction is not posted.
