Check to see that all values print into each box correctly.  You can do this in one of two ways, either print on an official W-2 form, or print on blank paper and check alignment with an official W-2 form.

* Edit each field as needed, using the X and Y coordinate values.&#x20;
  * If all fields need to shift up, down, left or right, use **Shift all**, and select the applicable direction from the dropdown.&#x20;

A preview of the W-2 data will appear in **Report View**; with two employee W-2s per page.&#x20;

* Insert Copy A of the W-2 forms into printer and print.
* Insert Copy B of the W-2 forms into printer and print.
* Insert Copy C of the W-2 forms into printer and print.
* Insert Copy D/1 of the W-2 forms into printer and print.

## Adjusting W-2 Forms for Printing

When printing W2s, if you find that the values, on the top W2, print in the boxes correctly, but the values on the bottom W2 print too high or too low, you can edit the vertical adjustment between the top and bottom form by navigating to **Payroll > Processing > W2s**, then follow the steps below.&#x20;

* Navigate to the **Printing Layout** tab.
* Click **Edit**.
* Edit the number in the **Vertical adjustment between top and bottom W-2** field.
  * If the field values need to print higher, decrease the number value.
  * If the values need to print lower, increase the value.&#x20;
* After making the adjustment, click **Save**.

* Click the **Print Test** button.&#x20;
* Print the test page to blank paper and hold up to the W2 form, to check alignment. &#x20;
* If the alignment is good, then print the W2s to the W2 forms. &#x20;
