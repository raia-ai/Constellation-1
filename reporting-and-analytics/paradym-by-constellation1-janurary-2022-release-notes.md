## RELEASE DETAILS 

Preview Videos

We have enhanced the process for creating Preview Videos to allow them to be posted to YouTube multiple times. YouTube can flag videos as spam when they are posted multiple times to one or more accounts. For example, if an agent creates a Preview Video and sends it to their broker, who also shares the video to the brokerage YouTube channel, the platform may flag that video as spam. 

This enhancement adds subtle differences to multiple videos to prevent this from happening. These include a different zoom and pan pattern or different background music on Preview Videos shared with brokers. These differences are sufficient for YouTube to not mark them as spam.

My Tours  

We have updated property tours to allow for a longer tour description. In some cases, we’ve noticed descriptions imported from the MLS are truncated, so we’ve increased the character limit for the description field. 

The full property description will now display on tours. This enhancement also has the added benefit of allowing the user to edit other fields and not be prompted with an error message about trimming the description. 

Holiday Postings 

We have updated the 2022 holiday dates so holiday content and postings will be delivered on the right day.  

Bug Fixes 

*   We fixed an issue with the broker’s image not showing on the Preview Videos of newly created agents. 
*   We fixed an issue with deleted videos not being removed from LinkedIn. Now when you delete a video post from the social analytics page, the video will be deleted from LinkedIn. 
*   We fixed an issue with the bulk action not saving when the user unchecked All Days on the social schedule page.
