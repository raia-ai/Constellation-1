# Batching to Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices

Depending on your volume or agreement with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices you will need to perform the Batch Process to upload to their Resource Center.

Here are the steps: 

**Batch Process**

*   Navigate to Utilities > Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Utilities > Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Batch Process
*   By default all transactions that closed since the last batch or closed transactions that had changes since the last batch are listed and selected, however users can selected as needed.
*   Select the Validate button, any transactions with validation issues will be displayed on the Validation List tab. The Generate Batch File button will enable if one or more transactions passed validation.
*   Only validated transactions will be included in a batch. Option to choose to generate a batch that excludes the ones that failed validation or close the batch manager at this point, fix the transactions with problems, then return to the Batch Manager

**Uploading Batches**

*   Users should log into Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices's Resource Center to confirm the status of batches submitted from the previous day.
*   If any transactions were declined, make corrections in Commissions and include those in the next batch.
*   If unsure how to proceed email the Support Team at commissions@constellation1.com
*   By default when the Batch Manager loads, closed transactions with changes since the last batch was generated will be listed. You can elect to include opened or cancelled transactions but these are not required to be submitted.
*   Option to re-generate a previous batch; this option exists mainly to make it easy to re-submit a sale that was previously declined without having to manually change the adjustment sequence number.
*   If a transaction was declined, it may require changing field values on the Franchise tab of the transaction or may require reversing the transaction, fixing, and re-closing.
*   If you are not going to use the re-generate option then you should manually change the adjustment sequence number to one less that its current value but if you decide to use the re-generate option you don’t need to change the value of the adjustment sequence. 
*   Open the Batch Manager: declined transaction(s) will be listed if any edits were made.
*   Switch to the Re-generate option and select the previous batch (or batch containing declined transactions). De-select any transactions that do not need to be re-submitted and generate a new batch.
*   The same adjustment sequence number will be used in the new batch for any included transactions as was used in the previous batch.
