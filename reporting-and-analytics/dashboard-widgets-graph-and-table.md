# Dashboard Widgets, Graph and Table

This article details the agent status, transaction status and applicable dates used to populate the various widgets on the Dashboard. 

Please note, the values displayed on each widget have been rounded to save space. If user hovers their cursor over the value, a tooltip will display the actual, unrounded value. 

**Last 12 Months timeline is 12 months prior to today. For example, if today is 2024-06-06, the widgets will include listings or pending transactions with applicable dates described below from 2023-06-06 to 2024-06-06**.
