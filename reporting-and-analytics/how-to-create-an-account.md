These are all the User Types available in eSign. Please note your access to them may vary depending on the type of Admin account you have.

*   **Group Support:** Provides the same access as a Site Admin account, but limited to the Group(s) assigned to it.
*   **User:** a User can create Sessions in their account and manage them.
*   **Limited/Read-Only:** Same access as a Site Admin but without access to Reports.
*   **Client Support:** this is the account your clients have to manage everything under their umbrella.
