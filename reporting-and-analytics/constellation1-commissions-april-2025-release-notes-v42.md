Bug Fixes

1\. System not recognizing partial payments when closing the main transaction Issue

Previously, we had identified a challenge where partial payments were not properly attached to the main transaction if the main transaction was migrated from Commissions desktop. This has been fixed.

2\. Bonus Override Journal Entries Not Balancing

We identified an issue where Bonus Override journal entries were not balancing.  We have fixed this credit/debit balancing error on bonus override journal entries with 3 bank system and tax is enabled.
