*   Select **Add** button (as displayed in screen shot above) and a new transaction will create with all the same information as the main. The transaction number will append an "A" to the end to designate the first installment.

*   The new transaction can be found at the bottom of the list of open transactions
*   Select **Edit** and navigate to the Commission tab to enter the amount of gross commission expected for the first installment. The commission for the Selling and/or Buying side will automatically calculate, including the values displayed via the Agent Commission Details window.
*   If the first partial payment transaction is disbursing the trust/escrow deposit in its entirety, you will need to enter the commission amount as it would be broken down into commission receivable and tax.  For example, a $20,000.00 deposit can be divided by 1.13 (tax rate = 13%) to get the correct amount of commission, ($17,699.12) and tax ($2,300.88).
*   Trust/Escrow Deposit; although the deposit is attached to the main transaction, it can ONLY be disbursed via a partial payment transaction.  To do this, navigate to the Deposits tab of transaction, select **Edit**, then the **Escrow/Trust** icon and **New**. The Action = Disburse and enter the corresponding amount to disburse (full or not). This also applies to any balance that may be due to the Seller for deposits that exceed the total commission payable.  If however, you forget to issue the balance due to the Seller or the interest amount to the Buyer you will be prompted/reminded within the application. 
*   In a Two Bank accounting system, the balance of commission receivable from the Seller **MUST** be deposited to the Main transaction before it can be disbursed from any of the other partial payment transactions. 

**You do not need to worry about the escrow/trust deposit ledger balancing at this time; everything will update as required once the partial payment transaction has been closed, processed and integrated to QuickBooks®.** 

*   You can override and/or change the Agent Commission Details amounts for this partial payment transaction if needed. However, if Force Validation has been selected, all payments will still need to balance to the amounts configured on the main transaction.  Once you have made your changes, select **SAVE**. 
*   You may now process this transactions’ closing.
*   Continue with the points above for each installment until the full commission attached to the main transaction has been received and paid. For each partial payment transaction (installment) created, the gross commission with automatically populate with the remaining commission receivable. You can only create a partial payment transaction by select the **Add** button on the main transaction. 
*   Once all the commission has been paid out in full, you MUST enter any interest earned before processing the main transactions closing. Navigate to the Interest panel within the Escrow/Deposit window on the main transaction, select **Edit** and complete the interest details as required. 
*   You may now **Save** and process the main transactions closing. Reminder: you cannot take any Agent Expense Payments when closing the main transaction.

**_\*\*\*_ _All applicable Reports, Sales Associate commission calculations and the D1 format of the Transaction Record Sheet will update with each partial payment transaction closed, processed and integrated to QuickBooks®._** 

**_\*\*\*_ _All QuickBooks® checks, deposits and journal entries will display with the letter appended transaction number and address._** 

**_\*\*\*_ _If this is the last payment of a Partial Payment transaction, you will be prompted with a reminder to close the "Main" transaction. This will ensure that any interest payable to the Buyer and/or applicable resource will be disbursed as expected._**
