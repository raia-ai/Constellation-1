SOCIAL POSTING&#x20;

Several changes have been made to enhance the performance of social posting. The main goal is to improve performance when handling increased volume of postings.&#x20;

On days where there is increased volume of content to be posted, we have streamlined the processes that post content. This means your posts will show on your social media as scheduled and on time!&#x20;

This update includes:&#x20;

* Updated API that is used to post your content.&#x20;
* Improvements to our database processes making them more efficient. &#x20;
* Built in processes to validate timely content before it’s posted.
  * Example, “Happy July 4th “ is not shared on July 5th.&#x20;
* Modified the posting process to retry posting content up to 5 times, at one-hour intervals.
  * Note, an item may not post due to the social media outlet limiting the postings.&#x20;
* Improved social analytics reporting.
  * Note, it could take up to 2 minutes to see the latest values of Likes, Shares, etc.&#x20;
