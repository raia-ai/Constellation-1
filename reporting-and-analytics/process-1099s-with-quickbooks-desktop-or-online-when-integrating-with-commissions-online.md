In January 2022, the Internal Revenue Service made changes to both 1099-MISC and 1099-NEC requirements. Details related to these changes implemented by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) can be viewed via [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1099mec.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1099mec.pdf "Instructions for Forms 1099-MISC and 1099-NEC")
