# Emails Sent to a Transactions User

### E-Mail sent to a user’s inbox with attachments

E-mails sent to [TPUserName@trpoint.com](mailto:TPUserName@doc.trpoint.com) add all attached documents to ‘Inbox Documents’ in the Document Center, but the e-mail message body is now available by clicking on ‘Message Details.’  In addition, messages and documents are also available in the new Message Center, discussed later in these notes (see ‘The Messge Center’.)

Document names are the same as the name of the attachment in the e-mail (but are limited to 100 characters; longer names will be truncated.) 

Removing a document from the inbox also removes the associated message link, but the e-mail will remain in the new Message Center (see ‘The Message Center’.)

If a document is moved or copied to a transaction, the associated message will be moved or copied to the transaction’s Communication Log.

Clicking on “Message Details” displays the original message that was sent along with the attachment:

This page contains the actual body of the e-mail message that was sent with the document.  .  (The message details are displayed in plain text only; links and images are discarded.) 

You can save the e-mail message in PDF format by clicking on “Save E-mail as Document”.

You can rename the document and it will be saved it to one of the following locations, depending on where you were when you selected ‘Save E-Mail as Document.’

*   The document will be saved in TRANSACTION if the click originates from the Document Center and a transaction has been selected.
*   The document will be saved in ACTIVITY if the click originates from the Activity Document box.
*   The document will be saved in INBOX DOCUMENTS if the click originates from the Document Center and a transaction has not been selected.

NOTE: Current “Document Report” functionality remains the same.  Receipt of a document into the Inbox is not included in the Document Received notification e-mail that gets sent out to TC’s/FAA’s every three hours.  Additionally, Inbox documents are not available in the “Documents Received Report”.  These notification e-mails and report are specific to a transaction.  But if a document is moved from the Inbox to a transaction, then the document will appear on the notification e-mail and report.

### E-mail sent to a user’s Inbox without attachment(s) – The Message Center

All e-mails sent to a user’s Inbox, [TPUserName@trpoint.com](mailto:TPUserName@doc.trpoint.com), will be available in the Message Center, a new location for incoming messages.  Transaction Coordinators, Full Access Agents  and View-Only Agents can access their incoming messages from the ‘Messages’ link available on the top right side of the page; as shown below.

Clicking ‘Messages’ will open the Message Center.

All messages sent to a user, with or without attachments, will be available in the Message Center for a maximum of 90 days.  You can sort the Message Center by the date the message was received, and can also search the ‘From’ and ‘Subject’ fields as well as filter by ‘messages with attachments‘. 

Each page will display 10 messages sorted, by default, in order of date received.  Clicking on the messages’ Subject will display details of the message.

Similar to “Message Details” view, e-mailed message details will be displayed in Plain text format only.  Clicking on the ‘Save E-mail as Document’ button will allow you to save the message to Inbox Documents as shown below.
