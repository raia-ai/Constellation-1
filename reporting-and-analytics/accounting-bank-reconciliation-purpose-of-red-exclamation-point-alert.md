# Accounting - Bank Reconciliation - Purpose of Red Exclamation Point Alert

The purpose of this article is to explain the purpose of the red exclamation point alert, should it appear in your bank reconciliation.

If a red exclamation point alert is visible, on your bank reconciliation screen, it means that some retrieved transaction records have had changes made to their source transaction records, since they were retrieved into the bank reconciliation, or a source transaction record has been deleted. 

When records are retrieved into the bank reconciliation, and then source transaction records are changed, the amounts and/or dates are not changed in the bank reconciliation, nor are they removed automatically.  If you have edited and/or deleted source transaction records, after having retrieved them into the bank reconciliation, they must be removed manually.  If they are not removed, the **Bank Recon to GL Balance Difference**, referenced on the last page of the **Bank Reconciliation Worksheet**, will no longer be zero.

The process for removing the transaction records, flagged as having changed, has been simplified for you.  All you need to do is click **Remove Selected** because the records have already been selected for you.  You can prove this by sorting the **Selected** column in descending order, by clicking on the **Selected** column label twice.  Sorting the **Selected** column in descending order will group all records, that have the **Selected** box checked, to the top of the column.

If you would like to print a report that lists the record or records that have changed, you can click **Show Edit List** and a **Bank Reconciliation Edit List** will print to screen.  Regardless of whether you print this report or not, you will need to click **Remove Selected** and **Retrieve New** again.

Note:  Removing source transaction records, from the bank reconciliation screen, does not delete the records from the system, it only removes them from the bank reconciliation screen. 

In the example above, the agent payment record for Mike Dust has been flagged, as no longer matching the source transaction record, and has been selected automatically for removal.  When you click **Remove Selected**, you will receive the following pop-up:

*   Click **"Yes"** to the pop-up

You will then receive an additional pop-up, shown below:

*   Click **"OK"** to the pop-up
*   Click **Retrieve New**

Following the steps above, 1 record has retrieved.  If you would like to review the record that was retrieved, sort the **New?** column in descending order, by clicking on the **New?** column label twice.  Sorting the **New?** column in descending order will group all records, that have the **New?** box checked, to the top of the column.

Note:  The **Date** is now showing as 5/22/2022, when it was previously 05/23/2022.  

At this point, you can continue with your bank reconciliation.
