## Bug Fixes

**Website**

1\. Fixed an issue with Home Valuation displaying an error message when the subject property address was not selected form the auto-suggest dropdown list.   
Previously, the Home Valuation would return an error message, if the user didn’t select the subject property address from the auto-suggest dropdown list.   
Now, this issue has been resolved. 

  
2\. Fixed an issue with <iFrame> code being removed from the agent’s professional profile.  
Previously, when an iFrame was added to the agent profile in the website admin, the system was removing it from the professional profile.  
Now, this issue has been resolved, when an <iFrame> is added to an agent’s professional profile it will display on the agents landing page as expected. 

3\. Fixed an issue with the alignment of the walk score icons.  
Previously, when the walk score section on a listing detail page was expanded, the icons would not display correctly.  
Now, we’ve fixed this issue, and the walk score icons will display as intended. 

4\. We fixed an issue with multiple H1 tags in the HTML code of the Market Trends report. 

Previously, the HTML code on the Market Trends search and report pages, included multiple H1 tags.  

Now, we have updated the market trends feature to include only one set of H1 tags.
