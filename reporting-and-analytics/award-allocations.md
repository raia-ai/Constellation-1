# Award Allocations | Constellation1 Customer Hub

Award Allocation - this function will provide the ability to assign an Agents’ sales volume, adjusted gross AND percent of end to another Agent on a per transaction basis for the qualification of franchise/brokerage awards without affecting the percent of end, commission portions, other fees, or any other existing calculation logic.

To configure this functionality, please follow the steps below:

*   On the Commission tab of the Agents profile who will be giving their production to another Agent in the brokerage, expand the Additional Configuration panel
*   Check the box for Award Allocation
*   Search for the allocated Agent
*   Enter the percentage to be allocated, typically 100%
