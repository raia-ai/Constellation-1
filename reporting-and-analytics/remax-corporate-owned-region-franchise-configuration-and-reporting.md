The exported spreadsheet will save to users PC's downloads folder, making it easy to find when uploading to Re/Max®.

**NOTE: Since MS Excel has its own formatting as it loads data, on occasion you may see non-date specific data in the following columns; StatisticsDate, CloseDate and EffectiveDate. To resolve this issue, follow the steps noted below:**

1\. Select one of the date columns; StatisticsDate, CloseDate or EffectiveDate then right click

2\. Select Format Cells
