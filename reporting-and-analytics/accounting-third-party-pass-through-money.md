# Accounting - Third-Party Pass-Through Money

The purpose of this article is to show how to account for commission deposits that are over or under the gross revenue of a sale transaction, referred to as pass-through money.

Generally, to make a sale balance, you need to receive a commission deposit equal to the gross revenue of the sale.  Sometimes, the amount of the commission deposit is can vary from the required amount.  To account for the difference, use the **Third-party** tab and check the **Pass-through?** box. Doing so will adjust the cash amount on the Commissions tab based on the positive or negative amount you enter on a pass-through line.

*   Enter as a positive value, if you receive more money than the gross commission revenue
*   Enter as a negative value, if you receive less money than the gross commission revenue

If you receive less money than the gross revenue of a sale, then you need to account for the shortage as negative pass-through and will need to add a third-party pass-through record. 

When you check the **Pass-through?** box, you will receive the following message:

In the following screenshot, the **Pass-through?** box is checked, the **Pay by AP?** box is unchecked, and the **Amount** is ($500.00).

Note:  A negative pass-through amount will debit the GL account referenced in the **Account** field.

In the example below, money received was $500 less than the **Gross Revenue** reported in the sale transaction.  Notice the deposit is $500 less than the **Gross Revenue** and the **Third-party Pass-through** is ($500).

When third-party pass-through is recorded, the **Agent Commissions** record will still reflect the full amount of **Gross Commission** on the sale transaction.

If you receive more money, than the gross revenue of a sale, then you need to account for the overage as positive pass-through and will need to add a third-party pass-through record.

When you check the **Pass-through?** box, you will receive the following message:

Note: If you need to pay an outside entity this money, then you will need to enter an AP bill, by navigating to **AP > Processing > Bills**.  When entering the bill, in most instances you will reference the same **Payee** and GL **Account** as selected in the pass-through record on the **Third-Party** tab of the sale.  

In the following screenshot, the **Pass-through?** box is checked, the **Pay by AP?** box is unchecked, and the **Amount** is $300.00.

Note:  A positive pass-through amount will credit the GL account referenced in the **Account** field.

In the example below, money received was $300 more than the gross revenue reported in the sale transaction.  Notice the deposit is $300 more than the **Gross Revenue** and the **Third-party Pass-through** is $300.00.
