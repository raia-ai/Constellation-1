Replace Posts on Social Schedule\
The Social Schedule page now allows users to replace scheduled social media posts. \

Reliance Data\
Auto Tours and Single Sign On (SSO) issues have been resolved with Reliance Data. Reliance removed Paradym’s access to the agent ID information. Paradym was not able to validate an agent account, causing the agent single sign on to fail. Furthermore, Paradym was not able to identify agent listings causing Auto Tours to not be created for new listings. \
Reliance Data is re-established Paradym’s ability to access the agent ID, allowing us to accurately validate agents.

Bug Fixes \
1\. We fixed an issue with the My Tour dashboard showing an error. \
Previously, when a user would delete the additional resources from a tour, an error would display when returning to the tour dashboard.\
Now, this issue has been resolved. When returning to the tour dashboard, the deleted resources will not be available on the tour and the page will not display an error.&#x20;
