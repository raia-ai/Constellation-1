# Paradym by Constellation1 August 2024 Release Notes

Production Release August 2024

## Release Summary

**Social Posts:** Improved handling of long posts to X.   
**Emails:** Enhanced emails for improved reliability.   
**LinkedIn:** Improved connections to LinkedIn.   
**Bug Fixes**

## Release Details 

  
Updates to X (Formerly Twitter)   
We've optimized long-form posts to enhance the user experience. If a post exceeds 270 characters, we automatically identify a logical breakpoint between 270 and 280 characters and split it into multiple posts. This approach ensures clear, consistent communication for our users.

  
Email Processing  
We've enhanced our email processing to reliably deliver all messages. Additionally, we now receive alerts when an email fails, allowing us to verify the email address and resend it when the email address is valid for current active customers.

  
LinkedIn Connections  
We have improved a user’s connection with LinkedIn to provide a stable long-term connection that persist for up to one year without any user intervention.  
Previously, users had to reconnect their LinkedIn account monthly to maintain the connection.

  
Bug Fixes 

1\. We fixed an issue with auto voice narration not working on some property tours  
Previously, the voice narration on some property tours was not being saved on some property tours.   
Now, this issue has been resolved. 

  
2\. We fixed an issue with Facebook posts not showing photos.   
Previously, posts to Facebook did not show photos due to Facebook not finding the photos on our system.   
Now, this issue has been resolved. 

  
3\. We fixed an issue with the activity email sent to agents showing an “oops” error message  
Previously, some agents would receive their activity report email and the body of the email contained an “oops” error message.   
Now, this issue has been resolved.
