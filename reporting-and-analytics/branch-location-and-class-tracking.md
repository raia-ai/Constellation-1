# Branch location and Class Tracking

This article outlines the use of branch Location in Back Office and Class Tracking in QuickBooks® and provides a brief synopsis of how values will be tracked by branch location once integrated to QuickBooks®. This information affects any corporate reporting (i.e. Century 21, RE/MAX, Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices etc).

Fees listed below will take the Branch flag from the Selling/Buying end as selected on the Commission tab of a transaction (Controlling vs Non-Controlling)

*   Transaction Fee/MLS Fee
*   Referral Fees
*   Manager Override Tax
*   Advance (& Finance Charge, if applicable)
*   Advance Handling Fee
*   Advance Handling Fee Tax
*   Withholdings
*   Agent Billing
*   Tax

If transaction is double-ended, fees listed above will use Selling end flag only, with the exception of Transaction Fees/MLS Fees. Transaction Fees/MLS Fees will always take the Branch flag from the Selling or Buying end of the transaction.

Trust Deposits, Interest, Processing Fees with applicable tax will all use the Selling end flag from the Comm tab of the transaction.

The fees listed below will use the branch location assigned to the Agent, whether overwritten or directly from agent profile:

Other Fees

*   "Off the Top" do not display as a separate line item on the Review Closing but included with Broker portion
*   Fees set up as Other Current Liabilities will not display on a Profit & Loss statement in QuickBooks®, a Profit & Loss reports income and expenses only
*   Manager Override will use the branch location from the agent who has the override assigned, not the agent/resource who is receiving the override
*   Broker Portion
