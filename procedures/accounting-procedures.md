## Procedure 3: Partial Payment Transactions

**Steps**:

1. A commission amount of $5000.00 when the agreement is firm.
2. 50% of the remaining commission may be paid when construction begins.
3. 50% of the remaining commission may be paid when the transaction is closed and registered.
1. Once a partial payment transaction has been created, it cannot be changed back to a regular transaction. You will need to cancel all payments and the main transaction.
2. Each commission amount received will be treated as an individual transaction, linked to a main transaction to ensure commission data integrity.
3. Each payment will be disbursed to all parties involved proportionately based on the allocation of percentages/amounts per side, commission rule and commission plans associated with each payment, including Bonus Overrides, Deductions, Non Commission Income, etc.
4. Commission plan(s) can be assigned to the Agent on the fly or amounts can be overwritten.
5. Edits to Deductions, Bonus Overrides and Non Commission Income are supported.
6. Reports will include all Payments and their detail individually.
7. All Payments must be closed before closing the main transaction.
8. **Force Validation on Commissions** – The main transaction is automatically configured with Force Validation on Commissions toggled ON, which means that the sum of all Payments **MUST EQUAL** the main transaction. If the main transaction is edited with Force Validation on Commissions toggle OFF, then it is your responsibility to ensure that all Payments equal the total commission receivable and payable on the main transaction, including all deductions, referrals, etc.
9. If the main transaction is cancelled, then all the Payments statuses will change to cancelled. However, if there are any Payments that have already been closed and processed, the main transaction cannot be cancelled until the Payment(s) have been reversed. For more information, please click here; [Cancelling a Partial Payment Transaction](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/knowledgeBase/15801127)
10. If the main transaction is closed, it must be reversed before any of its Payments can be reversed. Individual Payments can then be cancelled or reversed on their own without affecting other related Payment(s).
11. A Partial Payment Transaction cannot be a main transaction to other Partial Payment Transaction.
12. The Payment will inherit most values from the main transaction, including configuration in the Additional Detail section of transaction's Commission tab. The transaction's Deposit card and its interest calculations are excluded.
13. Please note that if any changes have been made to a pending Payment, the other Payments will NOT automatically recalculate. You will need to edit the values for each Payment accordingly.

## Procedure 5: Fiscal Year End Procedures

**Steps**:

1. Reconcile all bank and credit card accounts. Make sure your trust liability account balances with the total of your Real Estate Trust bank account and GIC/Term Deposit account. Clear out any balance in the suspense account and make sure the balance in your transaction clearing account is zero.
2. Close your books. The last day of the fiscal year is important in accounting because it’s the day when the books are closed. QuickBooks® lets you close the books by setting the closing date. This restricts access to any transactions entered on or before the closing date. Why does this matter to you? At the end of the year you typically print your financial statements. These reports show exactly how your company did for the year. The last thing anyone wants is for the numbers to change after you print the financial statements! The closing date keeps you from changing the numbers. To set a closing date, follow these steps:
3. Print reports. QuickBooks® offers several reports commonly used for year end reporting, however, you should check with your accountant to verify any particular requirements. Listed below are reports commonly used for year end:
