When it’s done composing, you can use the message as-is or refine it further by clicking another prompt like **concise** or **casual**, or by writing your own instructions.

Once you are happy with your message you can click the Use in email or Use in text button. This will insert the AI message into the email or text editor.

Once the message is in the editor, you can manually edit it as much as you like before sending.

**Important!** If there are any placeholder fields in the message (ex: {{agent.firstName}}, be sure to replace them with real information before sending, otherwise they will appear blank when sent.
