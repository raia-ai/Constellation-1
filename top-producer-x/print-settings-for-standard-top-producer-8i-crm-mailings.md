# Print Settings for Standard Top Producer 8i CRM Mailings

**Note:** This article covers PDF configuration for use with Top Producer CRM real estate software.

Top Producer CRM relies upon a PDF Viewer on your computer or browser to output printed materials such as letters, labels, and envelopes to a print device. As such, it is important to make sure that the print settings are properly configured for best results when printing. Issues that may arise from incorrect configuration include incorrect fonts and a variety of spacing and margin issues.

When you click the Print icon after viewing a print preview of a mailing activity (such as a letter, label, or envelope), you will be presented with print options similar to the examples below. The print options and correct settings will vary depending on the internet browser you are using. Click the appropriate link below for instructions that apply to your browser:

*   Microsoft Edge  
    Ensure that _Scale (%)_ is set to **Actual Size.  
    **

*   Google Chrome  
    For Chrome version 74 and later:  
    Ensure that _Scale_ is set to **Default  
    **
