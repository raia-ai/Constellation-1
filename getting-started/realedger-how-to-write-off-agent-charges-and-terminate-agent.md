The purpose of this article is to show how to write-off an agent's AR balance and terminate the agent. 

If you would like to write off an agent's AR balance, enter a credit for the amount they owe you.  To enter an agent credit, follow the steps below:

*   Navigate to **Agents>>Processing>>Agent Charges**.
*   Select the agent's name from the **Agent Name** dropdown.
*   **Date Accrued** will default to current date, but may be changed.
*   Enter a _negative_ value in the **Amount** field, equal to the balance owed by the agent.
*   Select **G/L Code** from the dropdown.
    *   This can be the G/L Code of the original agent charge, or you may want to select a Bad Debt account.
        *   Consult with your CPA for guidance on which G/L Code to use.
*   Select **C** from the Transact type dropdown.
