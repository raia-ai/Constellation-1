# Your Initial Temporary Paradym Password

When new accounts are created, users are assigned a temporary password.  This password is sent in a welcome email.  You can use this temporary password to log in the first time and choose your own password.

Example email with temporary password:

You will be taken to the "Reset Your Password" screen with an alert that the account requires a password change.  On this screen, enter your temporary password as well as your desired new password (8 characters or more, include upper and lower case along with at least one digit and one special character like # or > or ! or similar) then click SAVE.

As long as the password requirements are met for the new password, a screen is displayed indicating that the password has changed.   You will also receive a confirmation email (will not contain the new password) indicating that the password was changed.

Upon clicking Return, you are logged in.  If you wish to change your password in the future, you can do so from the Profile screen.  You can read about that in our KB Article, **[Resetting Your Paradym Password](https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/?TicketNumber=55706)**.
