## **BROKER AND OFFICE LEAD INTAKE SETUP**

## **Overview**

Lead Intake is an automated process to have leads sent from your 3rd party lead source, such as Zillow, Trulia and Realtor and have those leads added to your rDesk account.

Leads that are taken in at the company, broker or office level, will be handled in the same manner as leads from the respective websites. Your routing rules will be applied to the lead, rDesk will do the rest.

This process allows a company to automatically receive and route leads from multiple sources. All your leads will now be in ONE place for easy follow up and management.

The Company Lead Admin will have access to the lead Intake email address for the Company, and Broker or Office’s in the systems.

The email address will be in the format of; \[Company,Broker,OfficeNameOrID]@leads.rdesk.com

You will use this address on your 3rd party site to send lead notifications to this address.

## **Identifying your Lead Intake Code / Email Address**

To find your Intake code, login to your rDesk desktop account.

## **Agent Lead Intake Setup**

### **How to find your lead ingestion code / email address**

Lead Intake is a process also available to agents to send leads from external websites directly into _**your**_ Mobile CRM and rDesk CRM. Because the lead comes from your branded agent account, the lead will be added to your rDesk CRM account and auto accepted.

This process uses a code in the form of an email address to make the connection. You will need this code to have leads sent to Mobile CRM and rDesk CRM.

Your unique code is shown in your Mobile CRM app.

Using your mobile device, login to your Mobile CRM

Touch the hamburger menu (the three horizontal lines) in the top left corner to open the slide out menu

Touch ‘Lead Ingestion’
