**MLS/Transaction Fee Rules**

* Assign the rule a label (to distinguish it from any other MLS/Transaction Fee Rule entered) and enter a additional information in the description field.
* **Up To $**
* There are (4) four tiers/levels of an MLS/Transaction Fee Rule that can be used based on the sale price of the transaction.  This field holds the top sale price before moving to the next level for the calculation of the MLS/Transaction Fee.  For each tier/level you can enter a percentage based on the sale price of the property and/or a flat fee for both the selling and/or buying ends.
* If your Brokerage has additional base amounts for calculating the commissions based on the sale price, you would enter them accordingly on the **Up to $** fields.
* In the Selling portion of the screen, enter the Percentage and/or Flat Amount.  We support up to four decimal places for the percentage ex. 1.3478
* In the Buying portion of the screen, enter the Percentage and/or Flat Amount.
* **Minimum** – enter a minimum amount for the selling and/or buying side of the MLS/Transaction Fee

* By placing a check to the right of the "information icon",  the agent will automatically receive the amount that is over the Maximum amount configured.

The Discount rate will be calculated using the MLS Fee Invoice Received Date and the Estimated Processed Date entered on the Dates panel on the [Custom Tab on Transaction](http://emphasysrre.wpengine.com/kb/article/custom-tab-transaction/).
