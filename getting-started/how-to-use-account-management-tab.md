NOTES: 

*   Use the scroll bar on the right that will help you go vertically up and down on the page 
*   Use the scroll bar at the bottom that will help you go left to right on the page 
*   As you scroll left to right, the entitled columns will shift as well as you scroll 
*   You can choose a list of agents and check mark in the box to the left, THEN use the “Select an Action” at the top right to directly send a message to the group of agents you have selected 
*   If the agent has a colored (not greyed out) social media icon under their name, this means the agent has certain social media set up and is currently active 

*   If the agent has a greyed out icon, this means that for that particular social media platform for the agent, somehow the social media for the greyed out icon has been disconnected. There are several variables to why social media has been disconnected. Please partner with the agent and your Paradym team to see why they are no longer connected. 

       3. Setup Summary view will have a checked marked darkened circle icon and will reveal the agent setup summary
