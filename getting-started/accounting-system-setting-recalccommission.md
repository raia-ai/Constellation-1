# Accounting – System Setting RECALCCOMMISSION

The purpose of this article is to provide information regarding system setting **RECALCCOMMISSION**.

System setting **RECALCCOMMISSION** controls the default value of the **Recalc at closing** checkbox in the agent’s commission of a sale. 

The default value of system setting **RECALCCOMMISSION** is enabled, which results in the **Recalc at closing** box defaulting to checked, in the agent commission record of a sale transaction. 

If you disable system setting **RECALCCOMMISSION,** the agent$/office$ split will not change during the check run.  Note:  If your agents’ commission plans have multiple levels, you will not want to disable system setting **RECALCCOMMISSION**, doing so may result in the agent being underpaid.  You can, however, uncheck the **Recalc at closing** box whenever there is an instance where you do not want the agent$/office$ split to change when issuing agent checks.    

To edit system setting **RECALCCOMMISSION**, go to **System** \> **Setup** \> **System Settings**.

*   Filter for system setting **RECALCCOMMISSION**.
*   Click **Edit**.
*   Uncheck **Enabled?** box and **Save**.

Note:  If you have the **Sale Transactions** tab open, you will need to close it before opening it again, for system setting **RECALCCOMMISSION** to take effect.   

Here’s how it works:
