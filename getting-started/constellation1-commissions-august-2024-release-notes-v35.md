## Release Details

My Workspace – Upcoming Closings

This enables the system to accurately determine and notify users of upcoming closings.

Advanced Settings – Set a Default City for Transactions  
A new field has been added to the Advanced Settings, Transaction Settings under the Advanced options, allowing users to set a default city for new transactions.

When a default city is specified, the system will automatically populate the city field for all newly created transactions.

Imported transactions that have a different city than the default will retain their original city values.

Exclude Franchise Fees from Deductions   
Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices brokers now have the ability to exempt specific transaction deductions from franchise fee calculations. 

A new "Exempt From Franchise Fee" toggle, located in the Commissions module on the Deductions page, allows users to exclude certain deductions from these fee calculations.  

When this setting is enabled, the corresponding deduction amount will be excluded from the broker's Gross Commission Income (GCI) for franchise fee calculations.
