## **Team Website as the Team Leader, With Only a Team Website**

As the primary team member (Team Leader) your website and user account was used to create the foundation of the team website. You will have full access to edit and manage the team website. To administer the team website, update content, create jump searches etc., you will login to the website admin as you normally would. Once logged in, click on My Website on your left nav.

## **Team Leader or Administer to a Team Website with Multiple Websites**

**The following is specific to the workflow for companies that have opted to allow and have activated, multiple websites for an agent account.**\
As a team leader and team member, you have the option to have another website added to your account. This will allow you to have a team website _and_ a personal website. Your company administrator will need to add the additional website. The steps below will walk you through editing both websites.

1.  Login to Admin
