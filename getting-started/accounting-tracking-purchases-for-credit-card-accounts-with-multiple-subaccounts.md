# Accounting - Tracking Purchases for Credit Card Accounts with Multiple Subaccounts

To keep track of credit cards with multiple subaccounts separately, you can enter a unique vendor **Class** for each subaccount, or you may consider entering a unique **Projects** code for each subaccount.  For example, if you would like to provide a credit card to one or more agents, you can setup a vendor **Class** and/or **Projects** code for each agent. In the screenshot below, Agent 1 is setup with a unique vendor **Class** and also a unique **Projects** code. You do not need to setup both, unless you find value in both tracking methods.

The benefit of setting up a unique vendor **Class** for each agent, is that you can process every AP report by **Class**.  So, if you want to process a report for Agent1, you can select the vendor **Class** for that agent, prior to processing the report.  Below is a screenshot of the **Purchase Journal** filter tabs, one is for **Classes**.  &#x20;

The benefit of setting up a unique project for each agent, is that you can process 3 AP reports by project and you can process _all_ Income Statements, in the GL, by project.  The three vendor report options are shown below:

All Income Statement reports can be processed by **Projects**; the **Income Statement - Date Range** report is one example:
