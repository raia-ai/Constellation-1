# Accounting - 1099-NEC and 1099-MISC Directions (2022 and Prior)

The purpose of this article is to provide instructions on how to print 1099-MISC forms, for other income paid to vendors, and how to print 1099-NEC forms, for nonemployee compensation paid to agents in 2022.  This article also includes instructions on how to create an electronic file for submission to the IRS.  If you intend to submit 1099 data to the IRS electronically, you will first need to setup a **FIRE** account with the IRS before you will be able to submit 1099 data electronically.  You will need to setup your **FIRE** account as soon as possible, so that you will have time to submit a test file to the IRS prior to your final submission.

Prior to generating 1099s for agents and vendors, you will need to first purchase 1099-MISC and 1099-NEC forms, then follow the instructions below:

*   Navigate to **Agents**\>>**Setup**\>>**Agents** and confirm that the correct **1099 Form** is selected for each agent.  All agents, by default, will have the **1099 Form** set to **1099-NEC.**  If the agent is not required to receive a 1099, then you may select **N/A** from the **1099** **Form** dropdown.

*   Navigate to **Agents**\>>**Processing**\>>**1099s**.
*   On the **1099 Data** tab, select **Tax Year** 2022, from the dropdown list.
*   Select **1099-MISC and 1099-NEC** from the **Tax Form** dropdown list.
*   Click **Create 1099 Records.**
*   Select **Create 1099 records (all agents and vendors)** from the dropdown list.

Ensure all 1099 recipients have a **Valid Tax ID** number, if not edit the **Recipient’s ID #** field in the 1099 data record. Alternatively, you can edit the **Tax ID/SSN** field in the agent’s profile record, and/or edit the vendor’s **Tax ID** field in the vendor’s profile record and then re-create 1099 records.

Note:  If you have agents that are also setup as vendors with **1099-NEC** selected as the **1099 Form**, the tax ID numbers, and formatting of the tax ID numbers must match.  If they do not match, then two 1099-NEC tax forms will be generated for the agent.

    *   Check to see that all values print into each box correctly, either by printing to a 1099-MISC form or blank paper and check alignment.
    *   Edit each field as needed, using the X and Y coordinate values.  If all fields need to shift up, down, left or right, use **Shift all.**

*   Navigate to the **Reporting** tab and select **Official 1099s** from the **Report** dropdown.
*   Select **1099-NEC** from the dropdown to the left of the **Process Report** button.

*   Click **Process Report**.
*   Insert **Copy A** of the 1099-NEC forms into your printer.  You may want to print only one page to check alignment.
*   Repeat this process for **Copy B**, and **Copy C**.

Note:  All vendor records default to 1099-MISC, you may edit this by selecting the correct form from the **1099 Form** dropdown in the vendor’s **Setup** record. The options in this dropdown are **N/A, 1099-MISC,** and **1099-NEC.**  

If the vendor is required to receive a 1099, check the **Print 1099?** box to default each bill to 1099able.

![](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/api/attachments/action/1/b2db5b4f-dded-46a3-a819-2f4ce3e262f2) 

You can uncheck the **Count for 1099** box, in the bill, if a particular bill does not qualify for a 1099.

If you are required to, or choose to, submit 1099 data to the IRS electronically, you can opt to send both 1099-MISC and 1099-NEC data together in the same file, by selecting **All Forms** from the **Export** dropdown.  If you would like to report the 1099-MISC and 1099-NEC data in separate files, you can select **1099-MISC Only** or **1099-NEC Only**, prior to generating the export file.  In either case, select the **IRS Format –** **(excludes corrections)** from the dropdown, prior to generating the export file.

Note:  If you do not plan to print 1099s from the program, you may choose to generate a CSV file to use with third-party software. The CSV file contains filing and earnings information that can be imported into your chosen 1099 software.
