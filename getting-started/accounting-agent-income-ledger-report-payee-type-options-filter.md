# Accounting - Agent Income Ledger Report - Payee Type Options Filter

The purpose of this article is to point out new filter option, **Payee Type,** added to the **Agent Income Ledger** report.

A new filter has been added to the **Agent Income Ledger** report that allows you to filter by **Payee Type**.  The new option is at the bottom of the **General** tab of the report parameters.  There are four mutually exclusive options:  **Individuals Only**, **Companies Only**, **Not Entered**, and **All**.

When the report is processed, it filters the agents based on the selected **Payee Type Options** filter.  The selected filter is displayed in the report page header to the right, and on the same line as the **Zip Codes** filter.  In the example below, **Individuals Only** was selected as the payee type option.

To add a **Payee Type** for each agent, navigate to **Agents>>Setup>>Agents** and select either **Individual** or **Company** from the **Payee Type** dropdown on the **Personal tab** of the agent's profile record.
