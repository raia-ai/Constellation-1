*   Select **Check** from the **Type** dropdown.
*   Enter **Date Paid**.
    *   This does not need to be dated the same as the original. However, doing so will result in changes to historical financial records.
*   Enter the **Check #** to match the original check number you need to void.
*   Enter a negative **Amount** equal to the amount that you wish to void.
*   Click green plus sign (**+**) to select the **Payee** from original check record.
*   Select **Resource Type** from the dropdown to match the original check that you wish to void.
*   **Comment**, **Check Address**, and **Check City/State/Zip** are optional fields.
*   Click **Save**.

*   Do not enter **Date Paid**.
    *   The **Date Paid** will autofill after issuing the trust check.
