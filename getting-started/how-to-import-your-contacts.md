# How to Import Your Contacts

Your CRM provides you with the ability to easily import contacts. Before importing leads, you will need to prepare the import file. An example import file can be found at the bottom of the import page. Click the link labeled “See Sample Lead Import File”. Save the sample file to your computer for reference.

The import file will open in Microsoft Excel. Take note of row number 1 in the screenshot below, highlighted by the green cell outline:

There are two options when creating the import file:

1.  You can copy each column header (row 1) and paste it into the top row of the appropriate column on your spreadsheet.
2.  You can copy each column from your spreadsheet and paste it into the appropriate column on the sample spreadsheet. Be sure you don’t remove the column header from the spreadsheet.

**Important Note**: The text in the column header must be exactly the same as it is in the sample spreadsheet, regardless of the column it sits atop.

To finish importing your contacts, complete the following steps:

1.  Select the source of the leads you are importing. This will default to a Manual Import.
2.  Select the group (if any) the contacts should be added to.
3.  Click the Browse button to navigate to the import file.
4.  Click the Import Button. Your import will begin to process. An email will be sent confirming the import has completed.
