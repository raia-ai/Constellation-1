# "Oops! An Error Occurred" When Viewing a New Tour's Analytics

If you have a new tour, and wish to view the Analytics for the first time, and receive a "Oops! An Error Occurred" message, there is a quick and easy way to fix that.

Click your name in the upper-right of the screen, and choose Settings from the drop-down menu.  On the Settings screen, click on Branding on the left, which is the third option down.

Simply click on "Save" in the upper right.

That will fix the error that appears on the Analytics screen for a specific tour the next time you go to look at it.  Note that this error is most-encountered when your account is fairly new, usually on the first tour you have of a listing via Paradym.
