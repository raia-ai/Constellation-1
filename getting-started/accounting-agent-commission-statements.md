# Accounting - Agent Commission Statements

The purpose of this article is to provide you with directions on how to change the format of the agent's commission statement; including a sample of each format to help you decide which works best for your agents.

When processing agent commission payments, there are two **Commission Statement** options, the **Agent Commission Statement,** referred to as **Legacy** and **Commission Statement** referred to as **Default**.  To select which commission statement you would like to use, navigate to **System > Setup > System Settings** and filter for **COMMISSIONSTMT**.

* Click **Edit**
* Select **Legacy** or **Default** from the **Text Value** dropdown
* Click **Save**

The system setting that controls whether the other agent's commission appears on the Commission Statement is **CSRSHOWAGD**.  Editing this system setting will not change historical commission statements.  This is not the case for system setting **COMMISSIONSTMT**.  Once you change the system setting **COMMISSIONSTMT**, all commission statements, even the historical ones will print based on the new system setting chosen.

Note:  If you would like to see deductions from the Third-Party tab of the sale, then you will need to select the **Default** commission statement.  See screenshot below:
