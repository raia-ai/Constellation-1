# Accounting - Making Changes using Manage Subscriptions

The purpose of this article is to detail the steps for making changes to the **Default Percent**, **Default Amount**, **$ Ceiling** and/or **Count Ceiling** in **Pre-Split Deductions** and/or **Post-Split Deductions** setup records, using the **Manage Subscriptions** function.  

When making changes to the default settings for an agent's or multiple agents' pre-split deduction and or post-split deductions, you may find it to be a time saver by using the **Manage** **Subscriptions** function within the deduction's setup record.  To make changes using this method, first navigate to the **Agents** module, then follow the steps outlined below:

*   Click on the **Setup** dropdown.
*   Select **Post-Split Deductions** or **Pre-Split Deductions**, from the dropdown, whichever is applicable.
*   Highlight the deduction that needs changes.
*   Click **Edit**.
*   Edit the **Default Percent**, **Default Amount**, **$ Ceiling**, and/or **Count Ceiling**, whichever is applicable.
*   Click the **Manage Subscriptions** button.
*   Put a checkmark in the **Subscribe** column for each agent that is subscribed to the deduction, if not already selected.  
*   Click **OK**. 
*   Click **Save**. 

When you click the **Save** button, you will receive the following pop-up.  Be certain to read the pop-up before making your selection.

In reading the pop-up, you will notice that **"This does not change existing deductions in sales, only subscriptions."**  Which means that if you have pending sales for any of the subscribed agents, you will need to navigate to the **Sales** module and follow the steps outlined below.

*   Click on the **Processing** dropdown.
*   Click on **Sale Transactions**.
*   Highlight the first **Pending** sale.  
*   Click **Edit**. 
*   Navigate to the **Commission** tab.
*   Click the **Re-initialize** button on each agent's commission record within the sale, by first selecting their agent commission record from the **Agents** dropdown in the **Agent Commissions** section.
*   Click **Save**.
*   Repeat this process for each pending sale.
