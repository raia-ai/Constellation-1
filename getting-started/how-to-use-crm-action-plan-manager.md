# How to Use CRM Action Plan Manager

**CRM Action Plan Manager** is an integrated “drip marketing campaign” toolset that allows you to send email campaigns to your contacts, leads, and clients from CRM. These email campaigns are referred to as Action Plans.

Action Plans are made up of a series of emails or activities. CRM Action Plan Manager includes several plans (a.k.a. system action plans) you can use, or you can create your own.

Action Plans can be sent from an agent/user (a.k.a. individuals) or from an admin (a.k.a. organization). Each action plan activity sent is captured in the contact record in the Summary, Marketing and History tabs. 

You can also add Tasks for yourself to follow-up on specific activities within an Action Plan that can be added to your Calendar in CRM.

To access your Action Plan Manager, navigate to **Marketing > Action Plan Manager.**

*   **View** allows you to filter Action Plans by system generated or Custom Plans you have created. 
*   The **search box** allows you to search for any specific Action Plans.

To help you get the most out of Action Plan Manager and drip marketing campaigns, we are including some ‘best practices’ that will help make your campaigns more affective and have a greater impact.

**Make sure you have valid email addresses.** It is good to verify email addresses before adding them to a campaign and keep track of bounced emails to ensure they are only being sent to valid addresses. CRM does assist our customers by removing Invalid Email Addresses from receiving future marketing emails, but any efforts by agents to verify emails prior to including in an email blast could prevent bounced emails and prevent a degradation of your sender reputation. 

**Keep track of that open rate.** Low open rates on campaigns can also lower your reputation. When a user opens your email, it’s because they find value in it. More value = less spammy! Not opening emails means a user is maybe putting you in their spam or deleted folder. So reevaluate your content, see what works and what doesn’t, and stick to your strengths.

**Stay away from pre-purchased email lists.** These are full of bad emails and users that didn’t ask to see your content. It circles back to #1 & #2 above, but uploading a purchased list amplifies those risks. We recommend informing your agents of these risks and potentially implementing an email policy. When one agent sends to a bad list, it affects the whole company.

**Provide timely and meaningful content.** Emails should include content that is meaningful to the recipient. The subject line should be something compelling to engage and encourage the recipient to open and read the message. Keep message brief but meaningful.

**Include call to actions and links back to your website.** Email messages should include a call to action for the recipient to engage and interact with you or your website. Be sure to always include a link to your website in the email messages.

**Include tasks in your action plans.** As mentioned above, you can add tasks to an Action Plan. At a specific point in the plan timeline, you will be prompted to follow up with a Lead or Client and keep them engaged.
