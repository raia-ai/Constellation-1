*   Navigate to the Vendor Center
*   Select a vendor and the **Edit Vendor** window will open
*   Select the Additional Information tab and select **Direct Deposit**
*   Select the Use Direct Deposit for: \[Vendor Name\] box. Enter bank routing and account number, bank name, and account type
*   Select [Send confirmation direct deposits to](https://community.intuit.com/articles/1436444#detailscollapse12) \[email address\] if you would like Intuit to send an email confirming payment. If no email address is shown or if the email address is incorrect, add/change here or in the Address Info tab
*   Since C1 Commissions would be determining the commission checks,  it can be programmed to hit the appropriate General Ledger account. QuickBooks® will prompt to use an individual General Ledger account for each agent however this is not necessary as QuickBooks® will report by agent and produce 1099s with the use of just one commission account.
