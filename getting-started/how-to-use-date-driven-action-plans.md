# How to Use Date-Driven Action Plans

**We have two action plans that are based on a milestone date for the recipient versus the Start Date of the plan.**

These are calendar-driven individual level action plans\* called “Happy Birthday” and “Happy Home Anniversary”.

To add a contact to these plans, go to Contacts, search, and select a contact.

Click on the name link to open the contact record. Click on the Personal Info tab.

Click on the Date field for Birthday and/or Home Anniversary and select a date from the pop-up calendar OR manually enter a date. 

Click Save at the bottom of the page.

Click on **Marketing, Action Plan Manager** and then click on the **Happy Birthday** or **Happy Home Anniversary** action plan.

**Click Add Recipients** and choose the contact that has a date for Birthday and/or Home Anniversary by checking the box next to their name.

Click Save.

The Start Date is when the recipient was added to the plan.

The Send date is when the recipient will receive the action plan email activity (this is on the contact record).

The End date is automatically set at 10 years from the first send date.

You can also add the recipient from their contact record under the Action Plans section on the Summary tab and Marketing tab.

**Click Add Recipients and choose the Groups tab.**

Choose the group by checking the box next to their name. Click Save. Note:

Although the whole group is added, if any contact in the group does not have a date(s) for Birthday or Home Anniversary in their individual contact record, they will not receive the action plan email.

The Start Date is when the recipient was added to the plan.

The Send date is when the recipient will receive the action plan email activity (this is on the contact record).

The End date that is displayed as ‘blank’ but know it is automatically set at 10 years from the first send date for everyone within the Group.

You can also add a group from under Contact Groups, within the Action Plan section by clicking the Assign Action Plan button.
