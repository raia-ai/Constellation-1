# Accounting - Set Up Pre-Split and Post-Split Deductions

The purpose of this article is to provide the steps for entering a pre-split and post-split deduction, and how to assign to agents.

To setup a pre-split deduction, navigate to **Agents > Setup > Pre-Split Deductions** and following the steps below:

* Click **Add**.
* Enter unique **Deduction Code** up to eight characters.
* Enter **Description**.
* Select **Debit Account** from the dropdown.
* Select **Credit Account** from the dropdown.
* Enter a **Default Percent** or **Amount**, if applicable.
* Select **Percent of What** from the dropdown. &#x20;
* Enter **$ Ceiling** or **Count Ceiling**, if applicable.
* Select a **Vendor to Pay**, by clicking on the green plus sign, if applicable.
* If a vendor is selected, choose a **Bill Comment Option** from the dropdown. &#x20;
* If a vendor is selected, check the **Show Tax ID on Bill?** box, if applicable. &#x20;
* **Rank Order of Deduction** will autofill with the next number available, but can be overwritten. &#x20;
* Check **Anniv Reset?** box, if applicable.&#x20;
  * By default, a pre-split deduction with a **$ Ceiling** or **Count Ceiling** will reset on January 1st.  If you would like the **$ Ceiling** or **Count Ceiling** to reset on an agent's mid-year anniversary date you will need to check the **Anniv Reset?** box.

  * This applies to Washington state clients only.

  * This applies to Washington state clients only.
* Check the **E\&O Deduction?** box, if applicable.  &#x20;
  * When checking the **E\&O Deduction?**, enter a **Default Amount** to have the E\&O deduction in a sale transaction calculate the amount to charge the agent based on side count.
    * For example:  If a **Default Amount** of $50 is entered in the **Pre-Split Deduction** record, and an agent has both the **Listing Count** and **Buying Count**, then the E\&O will be calculated as $50 x 2 = $100.
