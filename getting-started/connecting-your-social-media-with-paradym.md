# Connecting Your Social Media With Paradym

Hello , 

We noticed you have a Paradym account with us but you have not been utilizing your opportunities to connect your social media networks.   
Connecting your social media to your Paradym account is a great way to have your visual tours of your listings automatically shared to your social media. 

Sharing them to your social media also increases your sphere of influence online but it also assists in getting your listings on more platforms for visibility. 

If you have not already created any social media or a business page for them, we would be more than happy to assist you in getting started. All you have to do is ask!

If you already have your social media business pages created but you have not connected them to your Paradym account - below is an easy way to get started.

You want to click on your name in the upper right and go into Settings.   
From here, click on Connections on the left, as depicted in the first screenshot. 

You will then be in your Social Media Connections page. 

You would then click on whichever social media site you have and then simply follow the steps it provides. 

We would love to hear from you! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, comments, or concerns. 

Thank you,
