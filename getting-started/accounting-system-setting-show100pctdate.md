After system setting **SHOW100PCTDATE** has been enabled, you will find that two labels have been added to the **Commission** tab of the agent's profile record, beneath the agent's current **Incentive Levels**.&#x20;

Note:  If you have the **Agents** tab open, when enabling system setting **SHOW100PCTDATE**, you will need to close the **Agents** tab and reopen it, before you will be able to see the two new date fields.  &#x20;

In the screen shot below, the agent reached 100%, in their current anniversary period, on 05/03/2022 and they reached 100%, in their previous anniversary period, on 11/2/2021.

Note:  100% dates are calculated when the agent's profile is viewed and are based on the agent's current **Commission Plan**.  If the agent was on a different commission plan in their previous anniversary period, then no date will be displayed to the right of the **100% Date Previous** label.  &#x20;
