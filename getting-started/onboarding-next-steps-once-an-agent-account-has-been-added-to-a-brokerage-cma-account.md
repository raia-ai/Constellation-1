# Onboarding (Next Steps), Once an Agent account has been added to a Brokerage CMA account

This KB Article explores the Next Steps in the onboarding process, once an agent account has already been added to the brokerage CMA account... 

If you haven't done so already, and you haven't added the agent account yet, please reference our first KB Article entitled "How to Add an Agent Account."  Once you have gone through the steps of adding an agent account, you are now ready to move on to the next steps in the onboarding process for your agent. What happens once the agent is added?

Step 1:   Once you have added the new agent account, the agent receives two emails back to back.

Step 2: The first email the agent receives is from [no-reply@paradym.com](mailto:no-reply@paradym.com).   It will include the agent's Username and a Temporary Password. It also includes the contact information to Paradym's Success Team and our hours of operation.

Step 3:  The second email that the agent receives is from Paradym Registration (registration@paradym.com).  It's purpose is to Welcome the agent to Paradym services and provide them with resources on getting started.  see screen shot below AND Step 3 continued.

Step 3 - Continued:   The email serves as a resource for the agent as they are just getting started, learning about, and setting up their Paradym account. They will also receive their individual Paradym account number and their username.  Note: The First email mentioned in Step 2 above will provide them with their "Temporary Password" needed for their account. Also, each of the "green" colored words or phrases in the email above are direct links:

"**my.paradym.com**"  -  Takes them to Paradym's account sign in page where they use their Username and Temporary Password to sign in.

"**click here**"  -  Also takes them to Paradym's account sign in page

"[**https://www.paradym.com/Success**](https://www.paradym.com/Success)"  -  Sends them to a brief one page form to fill out. This helps Paradym understand the agent's usage and account preferences so we can better help them get started

"**Click here to schedule your one-on-one training!**"  -  Sends them to a page where they can schedule an appointment with us for their Paradym Account Training session (1 hour duration).

"**Click here for getting-started training videos!**"  -  Sends them to a resource page with several unique self training videos they can watch on their own including:  a 49 minute video they can watch as they get started setting up their account without the need to schedule a one-on-one training with a Paradym member, a video on how to create a virtual tour, and several videos that will help the agent set up a social media page for each social media platform if they don't already have social media platforms set up.

"**Click here to visit our Success Academy!**"  -  This is a huge resource page for the agent which includes several blogs and videos they can watch as they are getting started. This is a great self serve portal for the agent to learn for themselves regarding Paradym's tools that are available to them through Paradym services. 

**\*\*** Thus, please also reference a separate KB Article entitled: "Paradym's YouTube Channel - Self Training Videos."  Paradym offers additionally, a YouTube channel that includes many, many other self learning and training videos anyone can watch to learn more about Paradym's tools and offerings.

"**paradym@constellation1.com**"  -  Opens up for them a new email template where they can email into Paradym directly if they have any questions, issues, or comments.
