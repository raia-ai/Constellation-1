**Production Release:** Tuesday September 2, 2025 10:00PM PT

**Release Summary** 

We’re excited to share the **first step in the eSign UI facelift**!   
This update focuses on giving eSign a fresh, modern design that’s cleaner, more intuitive, and easier to navigate. 

Alongside the new look, we’re also introducing an **in-app announcement banner** so you can easily stay informed about future updates right inside eSign. And as always, we’ve resolved several issues to improve your experience and ensure everything runs smoothly. 

👉 This is just the beginning: while this release focuses on design and layout, **bigger workflow improvements are coming later this year**.

*   **Tag Settings**  

*   *   A new **overlay design** gives the menu a cleaner look 

*   *   **Save/Delete buttons** are now fixed at the top. 

*   *   In the **Requirement** section, the **“Conditional” setting** has been updated to add descriptive text and comprehensive design.

You will now see an announcement banner inside eSign whenever a new release is coming. The banner includes a quick link to the full Release Notes, and you can close it at any time if you don’t want it to stay on your screen. (once you click Learn More or close the announcement, it will not reappear).

**✅ Issues Resolved** 

We have also made a number of improvements to ensure a smoother experience: 

*   **Reminder settings** are now consistent, so expiration dates and reminder intervals work together correctly. 

*   **YouTube icons** now display properly in email templates. 

*   **Copied sessions** now keep the same tag sizes as the original. 

*   **Dragging markup elements** no longer leaves behind stray copies.
