## RELEASE DETAILS

New! Enterprise Insights Lead Source   
We’ve added a new Leads page to Enterprise Insights that displays information about lead sources.  
This new tool is helpful for understanding where leads are generated and how much commission income can be attributed to each lead source.

 New! My Workspace   
We’re pleased to introduce My Workspace, a customized dashboard that displays a high-level overview of important transaction-related information. This information complements that already available on the Dashboard.  
To access the My Workspace dashboard, click the new icon in the top-right corner of Commissions Online.

My Workspace provides high-level information about:

*   Upcoming closings
*   Conditions due
*   Agent license expiration
*   Note reminders 

Each section details relevant information 7 days prior, allowing the user to monitor important data at a glance. Note Reminders that are more than 30 days overdue will not be displayed in this section.

New! Team Leader View  
We’re also pleased to introduce the Team Leader View.   
Team Leader View is similar to Agent View but provides additional access to transaction details and permissions for agents with the new Team Leader role.   
These include:

*   Ability to view key performance indicators
*   Access to the Commissions tab for team transactions
*   Ability to add or edit transactions

In the Manage Permissions section, we’ve added a new Team Leader View tab where administrators can grant Team Leader access to relevant users. In the Team Leader View tab, under Team Leader View Access, toggle Enable Team Leader View on.

 Administrators can also grant access to various reports and the ability to add or edit listings, transactions, and the Commissions tab.

Review Closing Report Hidden  
We’ve removed the Review Closing Report from the Agent View. This report would normally show with the transaction documents. Agents are no longer able to access this report.

Updated Master Templates   
We’ve split up the master templates for the Buying Broker Letter, Buyer’s Attorney Letter, Selling Broker Letter, Seller’s Attorney Letter, and the Seller Landlord Letter and created individual templates.  
The updated templates were created from the original master templates and therefore these outdated have been removed.   
This update will make it easier when onboarding new Commissions Online customers. These templates will appear as options under Transaction Contact Letter.   
The updated templates are:

*   Selling Broker Letter
*   Selling Attorney Letter
*   Seller Landlord Letter
*   Buying Broker Letter
*   Buying Attorney Letter 

This update does not affect any customized templates.

 We’ve also added Transaction Record Sheet to the master templates for broker records. 

New! Deposit Receipt Confirmation Letter Template  
We’ve added a new deposit receipt confirmation letter to the Master Templates list.   
The user can use this template to create a receipt confirmation letter for any deposit that they can share with the relevant parties. They can download the letter in PDF or Word format.

Users can access this template in the Actions menu of the Deposits section of a transaction. Click the three-dot icon for a particular transaction, select Deposit Receipt, select (M)-Deposit Receipt.dotx from the template dropdown, select the desired letter format, and click Run.

Award Allocations Override  
We’ve updated the Award Allocation form for a transaction to allow a user to override the award allocations.   
Users may now edit the following fields:

*   Ends
*   Sales Volume
*   Agent Side Gross Commission
*   Adjusted Agent Gross Commission
*   Company Net

Commission Types – Partial Payments  
We’ve added a new commission type for partial payment transactions.   
In the Commission Plan Details section, we’ve added Partial Payment as an option to the Commission Calculation Type dropdown. When this option is selected, the commission plan can include multiple (partial) payments and each payment can have a custom commission calculation.

Posting Trust Funds to QuickBooks®  
We’ve added the ability to post trust fund deposits immediately to QuickBooks®.   
When the Sync to Accounting System option is enabled, a Save & Post button will display next to the Save button on the Issue Term Deposit and Redeem Term Deposit modals, allowing the user to save and post the action to QuickBooks® immediately.   
This will eliminate the need to navigate to the Account module to update the posting.

User Status Added for Administrators  
We’ve updated the User Profile page for administrator users to now show their user status.    
This provides a quick and easy way to see if an administrator user is active or inactive. Administrators can have multiple roles within a company, if any role is active, then the account will be active.

Deleting Agent Users   
We’ve added the ability for administrators to delete Agent users. Under System Settings > Users, we’ve added a Delete option to the Action menu. The option to deactivate an agent remains as a menu option.

 Canadian T4A forms  
We’ve updated the process for generating T4A forms so that an accompanying summary file is also created.   
We’ve also added a link to the Government of Canada Internet File Transfer website to make it easier to submit T4A forms to the Canada Revenue Agency.  
In the Agents module, in the T4A tab, the user can select one or more agents, then click the Action button. They will then have the option to Review, Generate T4A, or Generate EFile.

British Virgin Islands   
We recently added the British Virgin Islands as an option for where a company could be located. This was in error. Commissions Online offers country support for Turks and Caicos Islands, not the British Virgin Islands, and so we’ve updated the option name to Turks and Caicos Islands.   
We’ve also added a broker record transaction sheet for Turks and Caicos Islands.

Monthly Statistics Detail Franchise Report Format - RE/MAX  
We’ve added the option to print the Monthly Statistics Detail franchise report as a PDF. Previously, this report was only available as a spreadsheet. The new report format is more user friendly and easier to read. 

Custom Reports   
We’ve added the option to add Transaction Group to custom reports.

 Bug Fixes  
1\. We fixed an issue with exporting reports for Canadian franchises.   
Previously, when a Canadian company that was set up as a franchise tried to export reports based on postal code, the export would fail.   
Now, this issue has been fixed. 

2\. We fixed an issue with incorrect trust amounts on the Review Closing Report for transactions with two banks holding trust.  
Previously, when a transaction trust account had two banks, the trust amount on the Review Closing Report was incorrect.  
Now, this issue has been resolved. Review Closing Reports for transactions with two banks holding trust funds will show the correct trust amount. 

3\. We fixed an issue with commission details on the Agent Production Summary and the Agent Incentive Level reports not matching.  
Previously, agent commission details on the Agent Production Summary Report didn’t match those on the Agent Incentive Level Report.   
Now, this issue has been resolved and agent commission details will match as expected.

4\. We fixed an issue with batch transactions returning an error when posting them to QuickBooks®.  
Previously, when attempting to post batch transactions to QuickBooks®, the batch would fail.   
Now, this issue has been resolved and batched transactions will be posted to QuickBooks® successfully.  

5\. We fixed an issue with the system setting the primary agent commission to $0.00 when a second agent was added to a Rental/Lease transaction.   
Previously, after a Rental/Lease transaction was created and an agent was added to the transaction, the first agent’s commission would be changed to $0.00 if a second agent was added to the transaction.   
Now, when a second agent is added to this type of transaction, the first agent’s commission will remain what it was originally set to.
