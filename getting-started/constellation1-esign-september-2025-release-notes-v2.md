# Constellation1 eSign September 2025 Release Notes (v2)

📅 Production Release: Tuesday, September 23, 2025 at 1:00 AM ET  

This month we’re bringing you two eSign releases instead of our usual one. Earlier this month we introduced our UI facelift, and now we’re excited to share an additional set of updates that make eSign even easier to use. 

Release Summary

We’re continuing to make eSign simpler and more intuitive with new updates to document setup, file handling, and integrations. This release introduces improvements that streamline workflows, clarify terminology, and expand your options for uploading files. 

What’s New 

✨ Easier CSV Upload in Bulk Sessions The CSV uploader in Bulk Session Step 1 now appears in a pop-up window when you click Upload CSV. This makes it easier to focus on your recipient data without cluttering the main screen.

📂 Drag & Drop File Upload When creating a session, you can now drag and drop files directly into the Documents & Recipients Upload areas to add the files instantly. This update makes starting a session faster and more seamless.

☁️ Upload from Cloud \- Phase I We’ve started rolling out cloud drive integration! You can now upload files directly from Dropbox or Box when creating sessions. Simply click Get from Cloud, select Dropbox or Box, sign in, and choose your file.  

And this is just the beginning - support for OneDrive and Google Drive will be added in upcoming releases.

📝 Clearer Naming in Templates & Packages To avoid confusion, we’ve updated some labels: 

*   “Template Draft” is now “Template Name” 
    

*   “Package Draft” is now “Package Name”
