📅 Production Release: Tuesday, September 23, 2025 at 1:00 AM ET &#x20;

Release Summary

We’re continuing to make eSign simpler and more intuitive with new updates to document setup, file handling, and integrations. This release introduces improvements that streamline workflows, clarify terminology, and expand your options for uploading files.&#x20;

What’s New&#x20;

✨ Easier CSV Upload in Bulk Sessions The CSV uploader in Bulk Session Step 1 now appears in a pop-up window when you click Upload CSV. This makes it easier to focus on your recipient data without cluttering the main screen.&#x20;
