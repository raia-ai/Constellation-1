# Accounting - System Setting GLSORTNAME

The purpose of this article is to provide information regarding system setting **GLSORTNAME**.

System setting **GLSORTNAME** allows you to sort the GL account dropdown selection list by account name then account number. 

The default is set to disabled:

With system setting **GLSORTNAME** disabled, the GL account dropdown selection list sorts numerically, by the 5 digit GL code number:

With system setting **GLSORTNAME** enabled, the GL account dropdown selection list sorts alphabetically, by description:

Note:  With system setting **GLSORTNAME** enabled, the matching will only be applied to the start of the description and not anywhere within the description.  For example, if you want to select the **Prepaid Rent** GL account, you would need to start typing **"Prepaid."**  If instead you typed in **"Rent"** you would not be able to select the correct GL account. 

To enable system setting **GLSORTNAME**, navigate to **System > Setup > System Settings**.

*   Filter for system setting **GLSORTNAME**
*   Click **Edit**
*   Check the **Enabled?** box
*   **Save**
