# Initial Setup Wizard | Constellation1 Customer Hub

It is now possible for new Commissions Online clients to setup their new environment on their own using a "self-serve" feature referred to as the Initial Setup Wizard.

Once the database has been created by Constellation1 and the initial sign in credentials sent to the master user of the brokerage, they can setup their new environment on their own without assistance from a support specialist. If you are unsure of an answer to any of the items or require any assistance, feel free to reach out to our support team for assistance via email at **commissions@constellation1.com.**

When you sign into your database with your initial sign in credentials supplied to you by Support, you will have the Initial Wizard appear which will guide you through setup of your program.

Depending on how your environment is created, you could see screens similar to the following and have the following options when completing each step:

* **Exit** to exit out of the Initial Setup Wizard.
* **Save** to save your changes on that screen.
* **Previous** to take you to the previous setup step.
* **Next** to skip that setup screen and proceed to the next Setup step in the wizard.
* If **Return to List** appears, it will take you to the previous list in that particular screen.
