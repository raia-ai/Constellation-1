To issue a check to the agent from each closing, navigate to **Agents** \> **Setup** \> **Agents**.

*   Highlight the recruited agent and click **Edit**.

When you select the **Recruited By** agent, their name will autofill in the bonus grid.  The default will show **CommissionShare** as **Bonus Type**.

*   Select a **Basis** from the dropdown, if appropriate.

*   The **Basis** is only necessary if **Default %** is used.

*   Enter a **Default Amount**, if appropriate.

*   Use this if the bonus for the agent is a flat amount.

*   Enter **Default %**, if applicable. 

*   Use this if the bonus for the agent is a percentage of the **Basis**.

*   Enter **Amount Cap,** if appropriate. 

*   Use this if there is a maximum amount that will be paid for bonuses.    

*   Enter **Count Cap**, if appropriate. 

*   Use this if there is a limit to the number of sales a bonus will be paid from.   

*   Enter **Date Cap,** if appropriate. 

*   Use this if the bonus will no longer be paid after a specific date.    

Note:  Bonus payments stop if one or more of the cap conditions are met. 

If **Bonus Type**, **ARCredit**, is preferred, you first need to enter a recurring credit.

To enter a recurring credit, go to **Agents** \> **Setup** \> **Recurring Charge/Credit Templates**.

*   Click **Add**.
*   Enter **Description**.
*   Select **Credit** from the **Type** dropdown.
*   Leave **Frequency** blank. 
*   Enter **Amount** of the credit to be received from each sale transaction.
*   Select GL **Account** from the dropdown.
*   Select **Project**, if applicable.
*   Click **Save**.
