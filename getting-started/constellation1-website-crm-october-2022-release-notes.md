## RELEASE DETAILS

**CONSTELLATION1 CRM** 

New! Contact Email Validation

We’ve added real-time email address validation for all contacts, leads, and clients.   
Agents can easily see if an email address is valid or if the contact has opted out of emails and verify unknown email addresses in real time.   
When an email is sent from the CRM to a contact for the first time, the system will validate the email address and display the results on the Contact Detail page. If the address has not been validated or if the status is unknown, the agent can click the icon to initiate the validation process.   
The various status icons are: 

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Icon | Mouseover text | Meaning |
| ![](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/api/attachments/action/1/19774505) | Email address is valid | Valid |
| ![](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/api/attachments/action/1/19774506) | Email address is valid, and user has opted out of select emails | Valid, but opted out of selected emails |
| ![](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/api/attachments/action/1/19774507) | Email address is valid and user has opted out of all emails | Valid, but opted out of all emails |
| ![](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/api/attachments/action/1/19774508) | Email address has not been validated. Click on the icon to check if the email address is valid. | Unknown status |

**Note:** The feature only verifies if an email address is valid. For contacts who unsubscribe or opt out of emails, we will display the appropriate icon and message next to their email address.  

Flyers

We’ve Improved the workflow when creating flyers. When creating a new flyer, the user can now see all tabs, not just the tab for the page they are currently on.

When creating a new flyer and selecting a template in Step 1, the flow will automatically move on to Step 2 for a more effortless workflow for the agent.   
We’ve also added validation to the required listing data fields to alert the user if any information on the flyer is missing.   
We’ve also optimized the code for the flyer module for a better user experience.   

  
Action Plan Manager 

We’ve made it easier to add and remove bulk contacts in the Action Plan Manager.  
In an Action Plan, in the Recipient section, we’ve added check boxes to the left column to allow the user to select one or more contacts that should be removed from the Action Plan.

New Contacts 

We’ve improved the security and workflow when adding new contacts to the CRM.   
Previously, when manually adding a new contact and registering them, the agent needed to send the new contact a password to allow them to create their account. 

Now, when adding and registering a new contact, the CRM will generate a password for the newly added and registered contact and send their login information to them directly via email.

**CRM MOBILE APP**

To Dos 

We’ve improved the To Dos module in the CRM Mobile App, making it more intuitive. We’ve added information about whom a To Do is related to and the ability to create a custom subject line. 

When creating a To Do from the Contact Detail page or in the lead follow-up workflow, the contact will automatically be added as the person whom the To Do is relating to.  
When creating a To Do from the dashboard, the agent has the option to search for a contact by first or last name and select the contact from the list.    
In both cases, the agent can also include a custom subject line for the To Do. We’ve replaced the pick list of subjects with a text field where the agent can customize the subject line. 

Once the To Do is saved, text will show above the calendar saying, “Relating To: \[Contact’s Name\]”.  
When viewing the To Do later, the agent will be able to see whom the To Do is related to, the contact’s primary phone number and the contact's primary email address. The agent can tap the phone number to call the contact or tap the email address to send an email to the contact. Tapping the contact's email address will open the native email application on the users phone.

**CONSTELLATION1 WEBSITES**

Consumer Social Media Login

We’ve improved the consumer account creation workflow so users can easily create new accounts with a single click.   
When a consumer is in the Save a Search or the Save a Property flow, they can now click a social media icon to automatically be authenticated by the selected platform and create an account on your website, saving them the time of having to fill out and submit a registration form. After creating an account, they will be taken to the Save dialog box where they can save their search or property.   
The improved account creation process is easier, more streamlined, and frictionless, so consumers can register on your site and save their searches or properties.   
We’ll soon be adding Apple ID as an option for social media (third-party) login. 

Updated Social Media Icons

We’ve updated the social media icons on the websites. The new icons comply with the branding guidelines set by these platforms.  

There are new icons for Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter.  

Client Login and Registration Pages

We have updated the layout for the client login and registration pages. The new layouts feature a side-by-side display with the form fields on the left and the option to log in or register using social media on the right. The new layout eliminates the need to scroll down the page to find the social media login options making it easier for the consumer to register or log into their account. 

This update has been made to the default layout. To update a custom layout, please contact your Constellation1 representative.

Client Dashboard 

We have removed the Connect with Your Social Networks box from the Client Dashboard.   
This feature has been underutilized and provided little benefit.

We have also removed the Connect layout from the website admin.

Listing Search Results Page

We’ve improved the listing search results page to load faster by updating how images are handled to reduce data usage. These faster search results provide a better user experience.   

Agent CMS Admin Home Valuation Widget  
We’ve added a new home valuation widget to the CMS website admin that can be added to a content page on an agent website. 

This enhancement provides a brand-new way for visitors to interact with your site and help you convert leads. After the widget is added to a content page, it can be linked to the top navigation for easy access right from the home page. Agents can also post the link directly to their social media or other websites to drive traffic back to their website and the lead-conversion opportunity on this particular page.

Agent CMS Admin User Interface Update

We have updated the sort order of the color palette options on the Design page in the agent CMS Website admin to be alphabetical. 

  
**BUG FIXES**

**CRM** 

1\. Fixed an issue with phone numbers not showing the entire number in the desktop CRM. 

Previously, if a phone number included a country code, the contact dashboard and the Details page would not display the last digits of the phone number. 

Now, if a phone number has a country code, the entire number will show. 

**Website**

1\. Fixed an issue with banner and logo images not showing on agent CMS websites.  

Previously, a selected banner image or logo may have shown as a broken image in the CMS website admin. 

Now, the banner image and logos will show when selected from the image library.
