# Email Integration - Needs reauthorization

If you see the following error, 'Please reauthorize your email account in settings' and Status, 'Needs reauthorization' when looking at the Email Integration settings in Top Producer X CRM it means there has been a change to your email account like a password change which is causing a disconnect in the email integration.

**Solution:** Remove the email account from the Email Integration settings, add the email address again and re-authorize.  Here's how:

1.  Start by clicking the trash can icon to remove your email from the integration settings.  When asked 'Are you sure you want to delete this email integration?', click Delete.

2.  Enter your email address into the Email field, then click Authorize Email

3.  You will be prompted to sign in or choose your email account to continue to Top Producer CRM.  Here you will provide your updated email account password if it has been changed.
4.  Follow the prompts and select all access permissions to continue with the email integration setup.  Below is an example of what you will see when selecting access permissions from a Google or Gmail account.

5.  Your email account has now been reauthorized.  A 'Please wait a few minutes while your email integration is being set up.' message will appear.

    After some time the 'Please wait..' message will no longer appear and you can now send email from Top Producer X CRM using the integrated email address as well as view Email History.
    

If after following these steps you are still seeing the 'Please reauthorize your email account in settings' message or are still not able to send email from Top Producer X CRM, please contact support by clicking the 'Chat Now' bubble located at the bottom right corner of your Top Producer X CRM, or email [support@topproducer.com](mailto:support@topproducer.com)
