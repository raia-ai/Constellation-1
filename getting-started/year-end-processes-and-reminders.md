# Year End Processes and Reminders

This article provides information regarding some configuration that should be performed at Year End **OR** on the first business day in the new calendar year, as applicable to your business requirements.

*   _**Agent Anniversary Reset (if your Agents' commission structure is calendar year driven)**_
*   Navigate to Utilities / Agent Anniversary Reset
*   Highlight and place check to the left of Agent's name or opt to "Select All" if all Agents are on the same calendar start date. **If users opt to "Select All", we strongly encourage that users individually click on each Agents' name as commission plans have been reset in error during this process**.
*   Users can opt to change the assigned Commission Plan at the same time
*   Select Reset button and the program will notify user that “Agent Anniversary has been reset successfully”.
*   Select OK and click “X” to exit the Agent Anniversary Reset window
