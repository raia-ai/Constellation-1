# Disbursement Rules | Constellation1 Customer Hub

Disbursement Rules are used to dictate how when the transaction closes how the funds should be disbursed. Or when a Brokerage is required to provide written direction to an Attorney or Title Company to pay commissions directly to Internal Agent, Other Brokerage, Referral, etc. 

To create a new rule, select NEW and enter a Rule Name that describes what the rule represents. For example, if the Attorney or Title Company disburses commission to all options selected, you could name the rule "Title Pays All"
