# Broker Guide: How to Use Office Accounts

## 📋 Overview

**Office Accounts** add a new layer of management between your **Broker** and **Agent** accounts. Each office now has its own dedicated login, dashboard, and workspace.

*   **Broker Account:** Top-level account with full visibility and override control.
*   **Office Account:** Middle layer where office managers can run office-level social media, set branding, manage agents, tours, and leads, and review office-level reporting.
*   **Agent Account:** Agent logins remain unchanged, but their tours will now also be promoted on office-level social media channels, increasing exposure.

With your **Broker** account, you can:

*   Create and manage office records.
*   Send credentials to Office Accounts for office managers.
*   Fully control any Office Account using the **Login As** feature.
*   Decide whether to enforce centralized branding (logo and preview video templates) using global overrides, or allow offices to set these locally and choose if they should apply across their agents.
*   Access office-level dashboards and insights.

**Important to know:**

*   Office Accounts are separate from Broker and Agent accounts and have their own login credentials.
*   Office Accounts include only office-level tools. Broker-only features (such as billing, company-wide reporting, SEO settings, and security options) remain available only at the Broker level.

### 🌟 Why This Helps

Office Accounts allow you to **delegate local management** while still maintaining top-level control.

*   **Local control:** Offices can manage their own branding, content, dashboards, and social media connections.
*   **Increased exposure:** Agent tours and content from each office are also shared on that office’s connected social channels, giving listings greater reach.
*   **Content management:** Offices can broadcast localized content and maintain an Office Content Library, supporting your agents with more relevant marketing.
*   **Flexibility with oversight:** You decide whether to apply global overrides or allow customization at the office level.
*   **Efficiency:** Agents stay focused on their work while offices handle local branding and content, and you retain broker-level visibility and control.

## 🚀 Create an Office & Send Credentials

Office Accounts are created automatically when you create an Office in Paradym. As the broker, you decide **when** and **how** to send credentials to the office manager. For all existing Offices, Office Accounts have already been created - you can send credentials to their office managers at any time.

### Send credentials for an **existing** Office

1.  In the top-right menu, go to **Account Management**.
2.  Select the office you want to manage.
3.  Choose **Select an Action → Send Credentials**.
4.  Confirm the email address and click **Proceed**.
    *   **Note:** The email shown in the confirmation pop-up is the current **Email** on the Office record. If this needs to change, click **Cancel**, then go to **Select an Action → Edit Office** to update the office manager’s email, and repeat these steps.

5.  A **Welcome Email** and a **separate credentials email** with login information are sent automatically to the office manager. (You will not receive copies.)

![](https://na3.files.teamsupport.com/TSData/WikiDocs/2472652/images/KB-ParadymArticles/KB-BrokerGuideOfficeAccounts/Emails.png)

The Welcome Email also includes:

*   A link to the [**Office Manager** **Quick Start Guide**](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/knowledgeBase/28586620) to help managers get set up.
*   An option to **schedule 1:1 training with our specialist** if needed.
*   Ongoing support resources available to both you and your managers.

### Create a **new** Office and send credentials

1.  In the top-right menu, go to **Account Management**.
2.  Click the **\+ (plus)** button in the Offices section to add a new office.
3.  Enter office details (title, address, contact info, etc.).
    *   **Note:** The **Email** field should contain the office manager’s email. This is where Office Account credentials will be sent when you choose to send them.
4.  Upload the office logo if you have one. (You can also allow the office manager to upload it later, unless your Broker settings are set to **override** the logo - if so, your broker logo will be applied across all offices and agent accounts.)
5.  _(Optional)_ Check **Send Welcome Email** and **Send Login Credentials** to immediately provide the office manager with access. If you prefer to wait, leave these unchecked and send credentials later as described above.
6.  **Save** the office record.

**Notes:**

*   To manage the global logo override, go to **Settings → Branding → Logo** from the top-right menu. Use **Override agent logo** to apply or remove the broker-level logo across all downstream accounts.
*   See the **Manage Overrides** section below for more about how broker, office, and agent settings inherit.

🔑 Login As an Office

As a broker, you can log in as an office at any time to configure settings or troubleshoot.

1.  In the top-right menu, go to **Account Management**.
2.  Select the office.
3.  Choose **Login As**.
4.  You’ll enter the Office Account exactly as the office manager would see it.

## 🎨 Manage Overrides

As the broker, you have the highest level of control. You can:

*   Apply overrides at the broker level (forcing consistency across all offices and agents).
*   Leave settings open so offices (and agents) can manage them locally.

#### General Branding Inheritance & Override Rules

*   **Broker overrides all (no change):** If you apply global branding at the broker level, your settings apply to _all_ offices and agents. Offices cannot edit them.
*   **Office overrides agents (new):** If you do not enforce broker-level overrides, each office can set its own branding. An office manager can then choose to override their agents, applying office-level branding across all assigned agents.
*   **Agent branding (unchanged):** Agents can only set their own branding if neither you (broker) nor their office manager has applied overrides.

👉 In short: Broker overrides always win. If broker branding is left open, offices gain the ability to manage and enforce branding for their own agents.

### Settings that can be overridden

*   **Branding (logo):** Go to **Settings → Branding → Logo**.
    *   If **Override Agent Logo** is checked → your broker logo applies to all offices and agents.
    *   If not checked → offices can upload their own logo and decide whether to enforce it across their agents.
*   **Preview Video Templates:** Go to **Settings → Video → Preview Video**.
    *   If override checkboxes (e.g., “Override Address/Agent/Company Scene”) are checked → your broker templates apply to all offices and agents.

## 📊 Monitor Office Dashboards

Dashboards give you visibility into office-level performance and adoption. From your Broker account, you can:

*   View social media performance for each office.
*   See tours and leads by office, plus upcoming social schedules.
*   Check setup completeness (branding, listing sync, social connections, etc.).
*   Identify where additional support is needed.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need to set up Office Accounts manually?**  
No. Office Accounts are created automatically once an office record exists. If you add a new office, simply create the office record and its Office Account will be generated automatically.

**Q: How do I give an office manager access?**  
Send credentials either while creating the office or later from the Office record in Account Management.

**Q: Can brokers still control everything?**  
Yes. You retain override capabilities for branding, flyers, video templates, and disclaimers, and you can log in as any Office Account at any time. Only you can access billing, security, and SEO settings.

**Q: What changes for agents?**  
Agents continue using Paradym as before. The difference is that their tours and content now also appear on their office’s connected social media accounts, increasing exposure.
