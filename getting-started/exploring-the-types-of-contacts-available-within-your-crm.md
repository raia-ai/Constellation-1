Managing leads and clients is a key aspect of growing your business. There are three types of contacts that can exist in the CRM. This section will define the differences and characteristics of each.

**Contacts**: People will show as a contact if they have been manually added or imported into the CRM. Typically, contacts are not in the buying or selling funnel. Contacts can be registered and promoted to client.

**Leads**: People who show up as a lead have taken an action on the website and submitted a Contact Form, Ask a Question, or the Request a Showing Form. They have been routed to you from your website.

**Clients**: People who show as Clients have either registered on the website, saved a search, or saved a property. Clients may have previously been a contact that you registered. They have an account where they can login to view and manage their saved searches and saved properties. You as the agent have exclusive access to view and edit their saved searches and saved properties.
