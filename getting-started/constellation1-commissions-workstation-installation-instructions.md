# Constellation1 Commissions Workstation Installation Instructions

This article provides instructions to install the Constellation1 Commissions application on other computers on your internal network. 

We recommend that your installer/technician ensure that this is done during our regular installation / conversion hours; Monday - Friday, 9:00am - 5:00pm ET.  This will ensure a qualified technician will be on hand should you require technical support.  If you require assistance, please email [commissions@constellation1.com](mailto:Commissions@constellation1)

If preferable, a technician from Constellation1 can remotely install Commissions on your workstation for a charge of $390.00 + tax, if applicable.
