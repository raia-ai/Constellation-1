# Accounting - Warning: No main office has been designated so there will be no office address on the statement.

The purpose of this article is to show how to designate one of your offices as your main office.  

If you have not designated one of your offices as your main office, you will receive the following message, when you navigate to **Agents>>Reports>>Charge Statements**.

When you receive this message, close the **Charge Statements** tab, then navigate to **System>>Setup>>Offices** and select your main office from the left selection pane.

After a main office has been selected, when you navigate back to **Agents>>Reports>>Charge** **Statements**, you will no longer receive the warning message, and you will see the main office address appear in the header of the agent's charge statement.
