# RED CRM Mobile - Getting Started, Trouble-Shooting & FAQs

**Is the RED CRM Mobile app available for both iOS and Android devices?**

*   Yes

**Can I use this app and be logged into multiple devices?**

*   Yes, since this app was designed with today’s modern use cases in mind. You’ll have the ability to login into multiple devices as long as you have the app downloaded for each respective device

**Do you have any "base" requirements for using this app?**

*   Yes, while this CRM Mobile app is in beta testing, we recommend that you use the app when you have better than 3G connection, and that you have less than 1,000 contacts in your overall CRM address book for optimal performance
*   Additional Note: We are currently working hard to address this issue, so that “Power Users” who have a large database of contacts can enjoy the benefits of this app without experiencing any performance lag or degradation

**Why am I getting so many different notifications for the same leads?**

*   If you're getting an email notification, a text message notification and a push notification for new leads or updated leads, or some combination of that, then it's likely because your Organization has those specific notification methods turned on
*   Some Organizations prefer to have only email and push notifications turned on to limit the confusion or redundancy of having so many lead notifications sent for the same lead event. If you're getting an email notification, a text message notification and a push notification for new leads or updated leads, or some combination of that, then it's likely because your Organization has those specific notification methods turned on

**Why am I not receiving any push notifications on leads?**

*   First, please check if you have the RED CRM Mobile app turned on for notifications. You can go to your mobile device's settings to "allow" for push notifications for the RED CRM app
*   For example, for iOS 11 devices, you would navigate to "Settings" icon, then scroll to find RED CRM, then select "Notifications", then "Allow notifications" to enable
*   Additionally, if you have your mobile device on "do not disturb" mode, then you likely will not receive the notification when your phone is on "sleep" and you won't receive a notification vibration alerting you of the notification

**Why am I not receiving any push notifications on To Dos reminders**

*   First, please check if you have the RED CRM Mobile app turned on for notifications. You can go to your mobile device's settings to "allow" for push notifications for the RED CRM app. Additionally, if you have your mobile device on "do not disturb" mode, then you likely will not receive the notification when your phone is on "sleep" and you won't receive a notification vibration alerting you of the notification
*   In addition, when you are creating a task To Do reminder, make sure you're selecting a "reminder" option in the drop-down selection options on the To Dos page (e.g. 1 min before, 5 mins before, etc), which is displayed and available for selection directly below the "Ends" time area

**What should I do if my app locks up or freezes?**

*   Some suggestions (in order of trouble shooting):
    *   Close out and restart the app
    *   If that does not resolve the issue, then "log out" of the app and log back in, then restart the app
    *   You can also check the app store (Google Play, Apple) for any updates to the app to ensure you have the latest version
    *   Uninstall the app, re-install the app and log back in
    *   Contact your Account Manager at RED as you may have found a bug, which we thank you for, as it will help us improve the app

*   Note: we’re frequently pushing updates behind the scenes to improve performance, so you may notice changes to the User Interface and performance just by simply using the app

**Why does the app seem to stall when I try to load a "Group" of my contacts?**

*   It's very likely that you have a large number of contacts in the specific group that you chose (e.g. your "Investors" group has 350 contacts in it), which causes "lag" in the app when you select that group. We are aware of this issue and are working to address this issue

**I received a "New Lead" push notification, but don't know where to find my New Lead?**

*   If you interact with the "New lead" push notification you will be directed to the Accept or Decline lead page to accept or decline the New Lead, unless the lead originated from your Agent website or came in via "Lead Ingestion" (i.e. you used our Lead Ingestion feature to pull in your lead from Realtor.com, Zillow, etc), then that lead will be auto-accepted.
*   When in doubt, you can always tap on the "Bell" icon, which is on the top-right hand corner of the app, which will direct you to the "Leads" page, displaying all your Unaccepted Leads, Leads Awaiting Verification (e.g. for your 3rd party leads such as Zillow, Realtor.com), Leads Waiting to Be Contacted, Lead Update Needed

**I feel as if I received my lead after the "retraction time" has elapsed and after the lead has been claimed by another agent - what is wrong?**

*   When a new lead is created in our CRM system our push notification service is nearly instantaneous and will even display the date and time stamp in the CRM "History" tab for that specific lead contact (you would have to go the CRM "desktop" application to view this information for that specific lead contact) for when the push notification was specifically sent
*   Your New Lead push notification will also display the time for which it was received on your mobile device in the push notification message body. If by the time you interact with your lead and the lead has been retracted, which means the lead has been routed on according to your Company's routing rules, then you will receive a message that states "Unfortunately, this lead is no longer available"
