# Accounting - System Setting HARDCLOSE

The purpose of this article is to provide information regarding system setting **HARDCLOSE**.

It is recommended that you post occasionally, whether that be monthly, quarterly, or annually.  This becomes important if you have already provided financial reports to management, your CPA, or if you have already filed your tax returns.  If you do not want users to backdate a transaction into a posted period, you may want to utilize system setting **HARDCLOSE**.  &#x20;

System setting **HARDCLOSE** prevents users from saving new transactions dated in a posted period.  If the user tries to save a record dated in a prior posted period, they will receive the following pop-up:

To enable the **HARDCLOSE** system setting, go to **System**>>**Setup**>>**System Settings**.

* **Filter** for setting **HARDCLOSE**.
* Click **Edit**
* Check the **Enabled?** box and **Save**.&#x20;

Note:  There may come a time that you need to backdate one or more transactions. This may become necessary if your CPA has given you an adjusting journal entry to enter into a prior posted period. In this instance, you can disable this setting, enter the backdated journal entry, repost through your last posted date, and then enable system setting **HARDCLOSE** again, to once again prevent users backdating transactions.  &#x20;
