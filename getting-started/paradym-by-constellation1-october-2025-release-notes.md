# Paradym by Constellation1 October 2025 Release Notes

**🗓️ Production Release: Monday, October 6, 2025**

## **Release Summary**

This month’s release is a major milestone for Paradym: we’re introducing **Office Accounts** – one of our most requested features for greater control and visibility at the office level. Office Accounts add a new account type that gives brokers the ability to provide each office with its own dedicated login and workspace. This allows offices to manage office-level settings, social media and content independently while still staying connected to the broker account.

This new middle layer (Broker → Office → Agent) adds flexibility, improves local control, and increases exposure for your agents’ listings and content.

## **What’s New**

### 🏢 Office Accounts

Office Accounts introduce a new way to manage Paradym at the office level. Each office now has its own login and account, giving brokers the flexibility to delegate local office management while still retaining full oversight. This new layer (Broker → Office → Agent) adds control, increases local visibility, and expands social exposure for agents’ listings and content.

**Automatic Creation of Office Accounts**  
When a broker establishes and configures a new office within their account, the system automatically generates an Office Account. Existing Office Accounts are already in place for all current offices associated with the broker's account. Each time a new office is created, a corresponding Office Account is generated automatically. Brokers have the option to designate an office manager and provide login credentials either at that moment or at a later time.

#### What Brokers Can Do

*   **Send Credentials**: Invite an office manager with one click by sending their unique login credentials.
*   **Impersonate Accounts**: Log in as an office to view or manage settings directly, just like you can with agents.
*   **Override Controls**: Retain full control over branding, logos, preview videos, flyers, and disclaimers where needed.
*   **View Office Metrics**: Access dashboards with office-specific reporting and insights.

#### What Office Managers Can Do (once invited)

*   **Review Office Dashboard**: Access performance data, tours, and leads specific to their office.
*   **Manage Office-Level Social Media**: Connect and post directly to office social channels.
*   **Manage Agents, Tours, Leads, and Settings**: Oversee agents, tours, and leads within the office, along with office-specific settings.
    *   **Automatic Tour Posts**: Agent tours are automatically posted to the office’s connected social channels.
*   **Broadcast Office Content**: Share localized content with all agents in the office (appears as _“Powered by Company”_).
    *   **Review & Schedule Posts**: Allow agents to review or auto-post office-broadcasted content.
*   **Manage Office Content Library**: Maintain an office-level library of shared posts and resources (displayed to agents in the _Categories_ section as _“Office Content”_).

#### Getting Started for Brokers

1.  Log in to your **Broker account**.
2.  Navigate to **Account Management → Select an Office → Select An Action → Send Credentials**.
3.  Use the **Send Credentials** option to invite an office manager.
    *   A Welcome Email will be sent to the designated office manager with login information and quick-start resources.
4.  Once invited, your office manager can log in directly to their Office Account to begin managing.
5.  You can always **impersonate an office** from your broker account if you want to review or step in.

#### Quick FAQ

**Q: Do I need to set up Office Accounts myself?**  
No. Office Accounts have already been created for you – all you need to do is send credentials to office managers.

**Q: How many Office Accounts do I have?**  
We’ve automatically created a separate Office Account for each of your existing offices.

**Q: If I add a new office, will that create a new Office Account automatically?**  
Yes. Whenever you create a new office, a new account is automatically generated. You can then assign an office manager and send them login credentials.

**Q: Can brokers still control everything if needed?**  
Yes. Brokers retain override capabilities and can impersonate any Office Account.

**Q: Will agents notice a change?**  
Agents continue to work as before, but now benefit from increased exposure: agent tours and posts appear on their own channels, the office’s channels, and the broker’s channels.

**Q: Will this change how agents post?**  
No. Agents continue posting as usual. If an office broadcasts content with review enabled, agents may see a notification before posting.

**Q: Can one agent also be an office manager?**  
Yes, but they will receive **separate login credentials** for the Office Account.

**Q: Do office managers have access to broker-only settings (like billing or security)?**  
No. Office Accounts only include office-level dashboards, tours, and settings. Broker-level features remain with the broker.

**Q: How does branding override work?**  
Brokers always have top-level control. If a broker sets branding (such as a logo) and chooses to override, that setting applies to all offices and agents.

*   If the broker does **not** override, each office can set its own branding.
*   If the office sets branding and overrides, it applies to all agents in that office.
*   Agents can only control branding if neither the broker nor the office has overridden it.

This same Broker → Office → Agent override hierarchy also applies to preview video scene templates.

We’ve extended your SEO settings to give you more flexibility in where your social media tour posts send clients. Instead of every post linking only to the tour page, you can now also drive traffic back to your own website and/or your listing search page.

This applies **only to Tour Posts.**

**New options include:**

*   **Search All Listings Link** – Add your “Listing Search Link” URL to all tour posts, so clients can explore your full inventory.
*   **Visit My Website Link** – Add your Website Link to all tour posts, directing clients back to your website.

When enabled, these links will appear automatically at the bottom of your social tour posts (except on Instagram, which does not support links).

👉 **Why it matters:** Every tour post can now serve double duty - showcasing the property _and_ driving traffic back to your website, strengthening SEO, boosting engagement, and creating more lead opportunities.

**How to enable links:** In the top-right menu, go to **Settings → SEO** and use the respective checkboxes to add or remove links from your tour posts.

*   **Note:** A Listing Search Link must be provided above in SEO settings for its checkbox to be active. For the Website Link option, you must first add your website URL in **Settings → Branding → Public Contact Info → Website**.

**Broker control:** Brokers can set and override links for all agents in their brokerage. If “Override Agent Links” is checked at the broker level, agents cannot edit the links themselves, but they can still decide whether to include them in their posts. If override is not checked, agents may apply their own links.
