# Office Manager Guide: Getting Started with Your Office Account

## 📋 Overview

Welcome to your **Office Account in Paradym**!

Office Accounts are a new type of account in Paradym designed specifically for office-level management. They give office managers their own login and workspace, separate from broker or agent accounts.

This new hierarchy layer (**Broker → Office → Agent**) adds control, increases local visibility, and expands social exposure for agents’ listings and content.

With an Office Account, you can:

*   **Connect office social media accounts** to run digital marketing at the office level and automatically share listings from agents assigned to your office.
*   **Manage office branding** and apply it across all agents in your office (unless branding is locked by the broker or intentionally left open for agents).
*   **Create and broadcast localized content** to all agents in your office.
*   **Manage agents, tours, and leads** belonging to your office.
*   **Access an office-specific dashboard** with performance insights, leads, and marketing activity.

**Important to know:**

*   Office Accounts are **separate** from broker and agent accounts. If you already use Paradym as a broker or agent, your Office Account will have **different login credentials**.
*   Office Accounts include only **office-level tools**. Broker-only features (such as billing, company-wide reporting, SEO settings, and security options) remain available only to brokers.

### 🌟 Why This Helps

Your Office Account gives you the ability to manage what matters locally while keeping broker oversight intact:

*   **Local control** – Manage your office’s branding, social media, content, and dashboards independently.
*   **Increased exposure** – Agent tours and content from your office are also shared on your office’s social channels, giving listings greater reach.
*   **Better insights** – Dashboards let you track performance, adoption, and engagement specific to your office.
*   **Content management** – Broadcast localized content and maintain an Office Content Library to support your agents.
*   **Flexibility with oversight** – You can set and override office branding, while brokers still retain top-level control.
*   **Efficiency** – Agents can stay focused on their business while you handle office-wide branding, social accounts, and content.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Once your broker designates you as the office manager, you’ll receive:

*   A **Welcome Email** with next steps.
*   A **Credentials Email** with your username and temporary password for your Office Account.

You’ll be prompted to update your password on your first login.

_Note: Keep this login separate from your personal Agent Account (if you have both roles)._

### Step 1 – Sign In

1.  Open the login link in your Welcome Email.
2.  Enter your Office Account username and temporary password.
3.  Create your permanent password when prompted.
4.  After signing in, you’ll land on your **Office Dashboard**.

### Step 2 – Review Office Settings & Branding

Before connecting social media or broadcasting content, take time to review your office settings.

1.  Navigate to: **Account Dropdown → Settings.**
2.  Review and configure:

#### Logo Settings

*   Go to **Settings → Branding → Logo**.
*   If you see options to **Add / Replace / Remove** the logo → your broker has not locked this setting. You can upload your office logo and decide whether to apply it across all agents in your office.
    *   To apply your logo to all agents: check the **Override Agent Logo** box.
    *   To allow agents to set their own logo: leave the box unchecked.
*   If you see **“Broker Logo Applied”** → your broker has locked the logo globally. You cannot edit it, and all offices and agents under the brokerage inherit the same logo.

#### Preview Video Scene Templates

*   Go to **Settings → Video → Preview Video**.
*   If you see **Replace / Remove** buttons and override checkboxes → your broker allows office-level customization. You can upload preview video scene templates for your office and choose whether to override agents’ templates.
*   If you see **“Broker Scene Applied”** and no edit controls → your broker has applied global styling. Both your office and all assigned agents will inherit it.

![Preview Scenes Setup](https://na3.files.teamsupport.com/TSData/WikiDocs/2472652/images/KB-ParadymArticles/KB-OfficeManagerGuide/Preview%20Video%20setup.png)

#### General Branding Inheritance & Override Rules

*   **Broker branding overrides all**: If your broker applies global branding, you cannot edit it at the office level.
*   **Office branding overrides agents**: If broker branding is left open, you can apply branding at the office level and choose whether to override all agents.
*   **Agent branding applies individually**: If neither broker nor office overrides, each agent can set their own branding.

This hierarchy applies to logo and preview video scene templates.

#### Other Settings to Review

*   **Branding** **section:** Ensure all fields are completed correctly (logos, disclaimers, etc.).
*   **Video Settings** **section:** Confirm other video preferences are set to your liking.
*   **All other Account and Tour sections:** Review and adjust defaults such as office contact info, tour settings, and other office-level details.

![Settings review](https://na3.files.teamsupport.com/TSData/WikiDocs/2472652/images/KB-ParadymArticles/KB-OfficeManagerGuide/Review%20settings.png)

Once you’ve reviewed and set up your office branding and defaults, you’re ready to connect your office social media accounts.

* * *

Connecting your office’s social channels lets you:

*   Automatically boost agent visibility by posting their listings on the office’s accounts in addition to their own.
*   Broadcast office-level content to your office feeds and to all agents’ feeds in your office (_“Powered by Company” posts_).
*   Strengthen your office’s online presence by using professionally designed Paradym content, scheduled and published automatically based on your preferences.

#### How to Connect

1.  Go to **Settings → Social Media → Connections** (or click **Change** in the _Social Connections_ widget on the Settings page).
2.  Select a social channel and click the **\+ (plus) button**.
3.  Follow the prompts to log in and connect your office’s social account.
4.  Repeat for all accounts you manage (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, X/Twitter, and YouTube) - the more accounts connected, the more exposure your office and agents will receive.

#### Choose Content Categories

After connecting accounts, go to **Settings → Content → Categories** and select which content types you want posted to your office feeds.

#### Set Posting Schedule

Then, go to **Settings → Content → Schedule** to manage:

*   When posts should be published to your feeds.
*   Whether posts are shared automatically or not.

### Step 4 – Explore Your Dashboard

Your Office Dashboard is your control center. Here, you’ll find:

*   Number of new tours, posts, and leads.
*   Social media engagement for office-level posts.
*   Agent adoption and activity levels.
*   Upcoming scheduled posts.
*   Quick access to analytics, schedules, and reports.

### Step 5 - Review your Functionality Access

Your Office Account gives you control and visibility at the office level, including:

*   **Agents:** View/manage agents in your office. You can impersonate agent accounts if needed.

*   **Tours:** Track property tours created by your office’s agents. Review, edit, and view analytics.

  
![](https://na3.files.teamsupport.com/TSData/WikiDocs/2472652/images/KB-ParadymArticles/KB-OfficeManagerGuide/Tour%20Management.png)

*   **Posts:** Review scheduled, published, and upcoming content.
    
*   **Leads:** Monitor leads generated through office activity and edit details if needed.
*   **Engagement:** Track how office posts are performing.
*   **Agent adoption:** See which agents are most engaged with Paradym.

* * *

### Step 6 – Broadcast Content

Broadcasting allows you to share posts and marketing content across the social media accounts of agents assigned to your office.

*   Broadcasted posts appear as _“Powered by Company”_.
*   Agents can decline posts if they don’t want them on their feed.

**When creating a broadcast:**

*   To **require agent approval**: check **“Send review notice to agents.”** Agents will get a notification and must approve the post.
*   To **auto-post**: leave the box unchecked. Posts will publish automatically, unless agents proactively unschedule them.

![](https://na3.files.teamsupport.com/TSData/WikiDocs/2472652/images/KB-ParadymArticles/KB-OfficeManagerGuide/Broadcasting%20guide%20s.png)

**Note:** Broadcasted content is saved in the **Office Content Library**. It does not appear in broker or office libraries. Only agents can see it under “**Office Content”** in their Categories Settings and can choose whether it posts to their feeds by default.
