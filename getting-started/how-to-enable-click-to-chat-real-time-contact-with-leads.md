* **Phone/Text:** Make sure you provide a mobile phone number that can receive texts.&#x20;
* **Auto Prompt:** This determines how soon the client’s chat box will appear on your tours. It is defaulted to 10 seconds. &#x20;
* **Best practice:** Unless you have a planned period of time that you’re unavailable, you can keep your status set to “Available.”&#x20;
* **Do Not Disturb:** This allows you to set time restraints on your availability. For example, my working hours are 9am-6pm EST. I have my Do Not Disturb hours reflecting that.&#x20;
* **Zoom Personal Meeting ID:** If you have a Zoom account, (if not- there are free options that allow 40 minutes of conference time,) paste your individual Meeting ID in the URL section provided. There is a “How-To” video link provided, as well. &#x20;

Step 4: Automated Responses:&#x20;

* **Auto-Prompt:** This is the default message your clients will see when the chat box first appears. All sections can be edited to your preferences.&#x20;
* **Introduction:** This will be the message the client first sees when contacting you. &#x20;
* **Unavailable:** This message will allow you to enter other methods of contact, and alert the client you have received their inquiry, but are unavailable to answer at that time. &#x20;

Step 5: Select “Save” in the upper-right of your screen.&#x20;

Once the lead, or potential client clicks “Let’s chat,” they will be prompted to enter their name and phone number. This creates a real-time text thread. &#x20;

With our Zoom integration, you as an agent can simply text the word “Zoom,” and your personal meeting ID will be shared with the client. This allows the first communication to go beyond texting, and allows you to converse face-to-face via Zoom meeting. &#x20;
