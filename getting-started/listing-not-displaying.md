If a listing is not displaying on the website, follow these steps **before** submitting a ticket:

**1) Check the listing in reDataVault (rDV)**

By looking up the listing in rDV, you are confirming that RED is receiving the listing from the MLS.

If the listing is not found in rDV, then the listing may not be getting sent to RED. In which case you will then need to verify that the listing is being sent from the MLS to RED.

**2) Are the membership ids in place for the affiliate/office/agent for the mls**

Confirm if the the mls memberships for the listing are matching in website admin.

Login to website admin and review the membership id section for office/agent. If your company has roster import setup, review the membership ids sent over in the BOI roster match for the listing.

**3) What is the Listing's Status?**

Pay attention to the listing's status: "Active", "Pending", "Withdrawn" etc. 

Depending on the status of a listing, it may not be allowed to show up on the website. This is determined differently by each individual MLS and configurations in rW (Board Variables).

If the listing's status in rDV is different than what is being reported, then submit a ticket to us so we can re-pull that listing's data correcting this issue. 

**4) "Show Internet: Y"**

Sometimes this option gets marked as "N". In this case, inform the agent to change this status through the MLS so it can be updated. 

You can review this option when looking up a listing in rDV. 

If all the above checks out and everything indicates that the listing should display on the website when it is not, then submit a support ticket and we will help investigate.

**5) Listing visible on Realtor.com as Active, why not on our site**

The feed that Realtor.com gets from MLSes is different than the IDX feeds provided to 3rd party vendors. lt is not always a true indicator on if a listing is available to display.

This is why we do always ask for a print out and to confirm that the listing is opted in for public/IDX display.
