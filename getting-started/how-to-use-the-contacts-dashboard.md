# How to Use the Contacts Dashboard

The **Contacts Dashboard** provides a high-level view of your contacts, leads and clients. The dashboard can be sorted and filtered in a few different ways. You can sort contacts by column and filter contacts by type (Contact, Lead, or Client). Additionally, there’s a “Filter By” dropdown option to filter contacts by type or within the past 30 days.

The following options are available within the contact’s grid:

**Check Box**: This allows you to apply a bulk action to multiple contacts.

**Score**: A score can be applied to a lead or client. The score is based on actions taken by the lead on the website. For example, if the lead submits an inquiry on a listing, they will get a score. If they save a property, they will get another score. A higher score indicates they are active and may be a lead you need to focus on.

**First Name**: Contact’s first name.

**Last Name**: Contact’s last name.

**Phone**: Contact’s phone number. Email: Contact’s email address.

**Type**: Contact, Lead, or Client. Contact’s Last Action Date: Displays the date when they were last active on your website. Mouse over “Details” to see what the most recent action is.

**My Next Activity**: Displays the date of a to-do action item.

**Saves:** Shows the number of saved searches and saved properties.

**Seller**: Displays an icon if the lead has been assigned to Sell My Home.

**APM**: Action Plan Manager. This displays an icon if there is an action plan (such as a drip marketing campaign) assigned.

**Action:** Accept, Decline, Reassign or Delete a lead.
