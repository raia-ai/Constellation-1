# Accounting – System Setting PROMPTFORBACKUP

The purpose of this article is to provide information regarding system setting **PROMPTFORBACKUP**\*\*.\*\*

It is important that you establish a backup routine as soon as you start entering information into Constellation1 Accounting. We recommend that you backup daily, and so each day you will receive the following message when logging out of the program.&#x20;

It could be that your IT backups up your server daily and you do not want to make a backup yourself or be reminded to when you log out of the program. If that is the case, you can disable this pop-up by navigating to **System** > **Setup** > **System Settings**.&#x20;

* Highlight system setting **PROMPTFORBACKUP.**
* Select **Edit.**
* Uncheck **Enabled?** box and **Save.**
