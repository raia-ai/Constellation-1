# Accounting - Team Commission Plans

The purpose of this article is to highlight setup and functionality of agent teams in Constellation1 Accounting.

The main purpose of setting up a team is to have each team member work towards the same incentive levels of a commission plan designated as a team plan.

**_Please Note: If a team has 2 team members (Agent 1 and Agent 2), Accounting includes the commission each Agent earned in the period defined in the Team Commission plan._**

**_For example, if Agent 1 was attached to 25 transactions using the Team Commission plan, the Incentive Level report/calculations will include those 25 commission amounts. And if Agent 2 was attached to only 20 transactions using the Team Commission plan, the Incentive Level report/calculations will only include those 20 commission amounts. The application does not add commissions from both Agent 1 and Agent 2 for incentive level report/calculations, it calculates each agent’s commissions individually and compares it to the Team Commission plan to determine each incentive level._**

For instructions on how to set up a team commission plan, please follow the steps found in the article [Accounting - How to setup a new commission plan.](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/knowledgeBase/17928403)

After the commission plan is setup, navigate to **Agents > Setup** \> **Teams**.

*   Click **Add**.
*   Enter unique **Team Name**.
*   Select the **Team Leader** from the dropdown.
*   Enter **Franchise Team ID**, if applicable.
*   **Team Type** defaults to **Associate** but can be changed to **Broker**, from the dropdown, if applicable.

*   **Effective Date** defaults to the current date but can be changed, if applicable.

*   Click the green plus sign (**+**) to add **Team Members**.
    *   When green plus sign (**+**) is selected for the first time, the team leader will be added to the **Team Members** grid by default.
    *   Click the green plus sign (**+**) to add other team members to the **Team Members** grid. 
*   Check the **Pay Leader?** box, if applicable.
    *   This box should only be checked if the team leader will pay the team member, instead of paying the team member from the sale transaction.
        *   Do not check the box to the right of the team leader.
    *   Note: If the **Pay Team Leader?** checkbox is selected, commission checks for that agent will be made payable to the team leader and the team leader’s name will appear on the check and/or ACH advice, but the commission record will still be associated with the agent that actually generated the commission.
*   Click **Save**.
