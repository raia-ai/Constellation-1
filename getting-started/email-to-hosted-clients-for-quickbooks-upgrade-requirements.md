# Email to hosted clients for QuickBooks® Upgrade Requirements

Dear

According to our records, you are using an outdated version of QuickBooks® that is no longer supported.  To remain on our hosted environment, and to stay compliant with our security standards, we require you to upgrade to a supported version of QuickBooks® as soon as possible.  (Please note: Intuit only supports the last three years of their desktop versions.)

To facilitate the upgrade, once you have purchased the new version, please forward the confirmation email from Intuit. This should include your license number and installation code. Once we have those, we can assist you with the software upgrade.

We thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. If you have questions, please feel free to reply to this email.
