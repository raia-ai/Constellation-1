### eSign - Sessions In Progress

Signer invitations are emailed out to signers and those signers enter the eSign application to electronically sign the documents.  As each signer signs, entries are made in the session’s activity log and email notifications are generated for remaining signers or the session is closed if none remain. Integrations typically receive notifications to their listener web service in order to catalog session information and collect signed documents.  The listener web services usually only require a session ID and status, but for client applications that require a tighter integration such as the ability to copy sessions from their own UI the service may want more information.  Speak with your eSign representative to get the best idea on how to approach tighter integrations.

### eSign - User Management

Typical integrations implement basic user management for access control and billing purposes. Basic user management involves maintaining references to user accounts in the eSign system through their respective unique identifier known as system user ID. This ID is obtained after creating a user through the API and makes it possible to push basic user information changes to the eSign system.  Storing this ID is crucial to ensuring a smooth user management experience.  User email accounts are required to be unique in the eSign system and can be activated and deactivated as a method of access control and for billing purposes.  For the best eSign experience the user’s time zone should be specified by the client in order to show meaningful data on documents and logs.

An API key will be generated and linked to your integration administrative account and provided to you for use in authenticating through the eSign web service.
