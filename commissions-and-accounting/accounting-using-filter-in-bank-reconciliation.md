# Accounting - Using Filter in Bank Reconciliation

The purpose of this article is to provide instructions for marking a series of retrieved bank reconciliation records as cleared, without having to put a checkmark manually into each box of the **Cleared?** column.

For example, if you would like to clear multiple bank deposits, generated from the **Bank** module, at the same time, you can first enter **BA-D** in the **Filter** field.  This will remove all records from the bank reconciliation except non-commission deposits that were entered in the **Bank** module.

Next, highlight the first record, of the series of non-commission bank deposits, that you would like to clear, by clicking anywhere within the highlighted section below.  **_Do not_** click on the boxes in the **Selected** column or the **Cleared?** column.

This will highlight the first record in the series of non-commission deposits you would like marked as cleared.

Next,  hold down the **Shift** key on your keyboard.  Then select the last record you would like to clear, by clicking anywhere in the highlighted area shown below.  **_Do not_** click on the boxes in the **Selected** column or the **Cleared?** column.

When you click the last record in the series, all line items to be cleared will be highlighted in blue, as shown in the screenshot below:

Next, check only one of the boxes in the **Cleared?** column, of the highlighted records.

As soon as you check one box, all records within the highlighted section will be marked as cleared.

This process works for removing a series of checkmarks as well.

To remove all checkmarks in the **Cleared?** column, uncheck one box within the grouping of highlighted records.

Once the highlighted checkmark is deselected, all checkmarks will be deselected, as shown in the screenshot below:
