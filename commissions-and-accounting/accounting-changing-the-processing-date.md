# Accounting - Changing the Processing Date

The purpose of this article is to show how to change the processing date.  The processing date is used as the default date when entering or generating transactions, like when creating agent charges.  It is also the date that prints on checks.  

To change the **Processing Date,** click on **File** in the upper-left-hand corner of the main screen.  This will reveal the **Processing Date** field, which can be edited manually, or the date can be selected from the calendar to the right of the field.

When the **Processing Date** is changed, the date will appear in red to the right of **File**, as a reminder to change it back to the current date when finished entering transactions or issuing checks for that date.

Note, if you do not log out of the program each day, the system date will not advance automatically.  For example, if you do not log out of the program on 03/03/2022, then when you begin your day on 03/04/2022, the **Processing Date** will still be set to 03/03/2022 and there will be no indication that the **Processing Date** is not set to the current date.
