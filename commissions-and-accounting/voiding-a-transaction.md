# Voiding a Transaction | Constellation1 Customer Hub

Voiding a transaction should only be performed when a deal has fallen through and/or in the event a transaction has been entered in error (as a duplicate, for example). Once a transaction is voided, the Status will be changed to V.

**Voiding a Transaction without Trust Deposit**

Select the transaction and select Void Deal

Voided transactions can also be un-voided, by performing an Advance search and selecting the option to Unvoid Deal.

**Voiding a Transaction with a Real Estate Trust Deposit**

Select the transaction that you wish to void

*   On the transaction, select the Deposits tab > **Edit**
*   Select the **Escrow/ Trust icon** and complete the Real Estate Trust Deposit screen as follows:
*   Select **New**
*   **Action** - select Disburse: the system will apply the disbursement logic based on the option selected
*   Select “Term Deposit/GIC” if applicable
*   Deposit Date: select the date that this check/cheque will be disbursed from the trust account.  It is imperative that  correct date be entered here, as Back Office will send this disbursement to QuickBooks® and make bank reconciliations easier
*   Branch/Office Location: if multiple offices, select the correct one affiliated with this disbursement
*   Post To Accounting
*   The default is to always post however if a check has already been issued, there is an option to disable the disbursement to QuickBooks®.  This option will overwrite criteria selected in the Company Profile
*   Post Immediately
*   Selecting this option will send the deposit directly to QuickBooks**®** 
*   If there is interest attached to the original deposit, a prompt will appear to disburse or not:
*   Select Save and close the Escrow/Trust Deposits window
*   Save the transaction, the Deposit Paid field should now display “0.00”
*   Click on VOID to change the transaction status.
