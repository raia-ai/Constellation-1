# Entering Agent Advances | Constellation1 Customer Hub

If your agent has been approved to take an advance from a future commission, or the brokerage advances money to an agent on their next transaction, this needs to be recorded so that it can also be re paid.&#x20;

* Enter Advance by going to Transaction/Commission Tab/Highlight Agent in table and click on the $ icon on left (Advances).
* If the Agent is on both ends of the transaction, you must create a separate advance for each end of the transaction. &#x20;

* Enter the Reference No. field at this time, if required &#x20;
* Select the Advance Date &#x20;
* Select Advance Company Type If (your own company name) as the Advance Company the resource will be B Broker, if from an Advance Company then M Miscellaneous resource will be selected.&#x20;
* Enter the Advance Amount Paid &#x20;
* Finance Charge should be used for 3rd Party Advance processing fees or leave this field blank &#x20;
* The Agent Advance Handling Fee field may be used in the event the broker (you) charges a fee to your Agents.  If applicable, complete Agent Advance Handling Fee and applicable Tax fields &#x20;
* The To Advance Co field will populate with the total of all amounts as entered above. &#x20;
* Select the Advance letter and generate if applicable &#x20;

_Reminder:_ &#x20;

_If an advance was already assigned to an Agent, you must reassign it to another transaction and recalculate the finance and/or handling fees accordingly._&#x20;

_IN THE EVENT THE ADVANCE RECEIVED IS LESS THAN THE ORIGINAL ADVANCE PAID, IT IS UP TO THE USER TO REASSIGN THE ADVANCE BALANCE OWING TO ANOTHER OPEN TRANSACTION – USING THE NEW ADVANCE AMOUNT PAID FIELD – BUT NOT POSTING TO EITHER ACCOUNTING OR QUICKBOOKS®._  &#x20;

Once an advance has been attached to a transaction, we will display the following $ icon so that the transaction is easily identifiable via the bottom right corner of the Home Screen screen. &#x20;
