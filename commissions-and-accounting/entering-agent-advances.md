# Entering Agent Advances | Constellation1 Customer Hub

If your agent has been approved to take an advance from a future commission, or the brokerage advances money to an agent on their next transaction, this needs to be recorded so that it can also be re paid. 

*   Enter Advance by going to Transaction/Commission Tab/Highlight Agent in table and click on the $ icon on left (Advances).
*   If the Agent is on both ends of the transaction, you must create a separate advance for each end of the transaction.

*   Enter the Reference No. field at this time, if required  
*   Select the Advance Date  
*   Select Advance Company Type If (your own company name) as the Advance Company the resource will be B Broker, if from an Advance Company then M Miscellaneous resource will be selected. 
*   Enter the Advance Amount Paid  
*   Finance Charge should be used for 3rd Party Advance processing fees or leave this field blank  
*   The Agent Advance Handling Fee field may be used in the event the broker (you) charges a fee to your Agents.  If applicable, complete Agent Advance Handling Fee and applicable Tax fields  
*   The To Advance Co field will populate with the total of all amounts as entered above.  
*   Select the Advance letter and generate if applicable  
*   If you want a check/cheque to be created and integrated to QuickBooks® at the time of creating the advance, you can make the following selections and a check/cheque will be issued from the General/Operating bank account and be payable to the agent for the amount entered by user.  

_Reminder:_  

_If an advance was already assigned to an Agent, you must reassign it to another transaction and recalculate the finance and/or handling fees accordingly._

_IN THE EVENT THE ADVANCE RECEIVED IS LESS THAN THE ORIGINAL ADVANCE PAID, IT IS UP TO THE USER TO REASSIGN THE ADVANCE BALANCE OWING TO ANOTHER OPEN TRANSACTION – USING THE NEW ADVANCE AMOUNT PAID FIELD – BUT NOT POSTING TO EITHER ACCOUNTING OR QUICKBOOKS®._
