_Please note: This functionality forces all registered workstations through a clean up process, meaning if your computer crashed with Commissions open, the program may be using one of your licenses, causing other users the inability to launch the program from another workstation. It will remove all the registered workstations from the licensing system. This may cause current users that are logged in to quit Commissions without any warning that can result in loss of data._
