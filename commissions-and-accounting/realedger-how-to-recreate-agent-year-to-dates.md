# REALedger - How to recreate agent year to dates

The purpose of this article is to provide steps for recreating agent year to date values. This utility is provided in case you need to update commission and deduction totals in the Agent Master Files. This utility should be ran each time you void a sale, void an agent's check, or enter an Historical sale. It is also the utility you will run before closing the calendar year in preparation for 1099s.  

To recreate agent year to date totals, navigate to **System** > **Maintenance >** Recreate Agent YTDs. 

Click on the **Agents** tab and make certain all agents are selected:
