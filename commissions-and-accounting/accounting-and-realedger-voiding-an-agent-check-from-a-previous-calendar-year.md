# Accounting and REALedger - Voiding an Agent Check from a Previous Calendar Year

This article outlines the steps to correctly handle a requirement to void an agent check in the sales module in a previous calendar year.

*   Instead of voiding the agent check, which will have an impact on your previous and current year’s financials, set the agent up as a vendor.
*   Then create a negative manual bill for the amount of the check, referencing the check number you wish to void. Then enter a new unpaid bill for that vendor and issue them a new check. 
*   Code both the manual bill and the unpaid bill to your commission account. 
*   The two records will net to zero, so will have no impact on your previous or current year financials.
