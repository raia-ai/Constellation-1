# Accounting - How to Account for Missed or Underpaid Referral

This purpose of this article is to outline the steps needed to account for a missed or underpaid referral in a sale transaction.

To correct a closed sale, where the agent was overpaid due to a missed or underpaid referral, navigate to **Sales > Processing > Sales Transactions > Closed** view. 

*   Highlight the applicable sale and click **Edit**.
*   Navigate to the **Third-party** tab. 
*   Click on the green plus sign to add the referral.
*   Navigate to the **Commission** tab.
*   Click green plus sign to add another **Agent Commission** record to the sale.
    *   The amount of the missed referral will auto-fill the **Gross Commission** as a negative value equal to the missed referral amount
*   Do not enter a **Selling Count**, **Buying Count** or **E&O Count**.
*   Select **Z:  Commission/Incentive Adjustment or Other** from the **Category** dropdown.
*   **Pre-Split Deductions**, that were calculated as **Percent** of **Gross Commission** will auto-fill as a negative value.
    *   If the agent has other **Pre-Split Deductions** that auto-fill with each commission record, review these carefully to see if they need to be Zero'd out.  An example of these types of deductions are pre-split deductions for transaction fees, they may have already been accounted for with the agent's original payment.   
*   **Office$** and **Agent$** will auto-fill as negative values proportionally based on the agent's current **Incentive Level** but can be overwritten to reflect the **Incentive Level** they were on when the sale originally closed.
    *   If you overwrite the agent/office split, uncheck the **Recalc at closing** box, located beneath the **Post-Split Deductions** section.
*   The amount the agent was overpaid will populate as a negative **ACHG** post-split and reduce the **Agent Payment** to $0.00
    *   If the agent has other **Post-Split Deductions** that auto-fill with each commission record, review these carefully to see if they need to be Zero'd out.  An example of these types of deductions are post-split deductions for transaction fees, they may have already been accounted for with the agent's original payment. 
*   Click **Save**.
*   Change the **Processing Date** to the date the agent was originally paid.
    *   You can change the **Processing Date** by clicking on **File**, in the upper lefthand corner of the program.  
*   Step through the **Issue Commission Payments** process.
    *   This step _is necessary_, even though the agent's payment will be 0.00.

After stepping through the **Issue Commission Payments** process, an agent charge will be created for the agent, to be repaid with their next closing and an AP bill will be created for the vendor associated with the referral.  If you prefer, you can request a check from the agent, for the amount of the overpayment, and enter a non-commission agent deposit in the bank module. 

*   Navigate to **AP > Processing > Pay Bills** to pay the referral.
