# Accounting - Historical Sales | Constellation1 Customer Hub

The purpose of this article is to explain the purpose of historical sales and the correct way to enter a historical sale. 

Historical sales provide a means for entering adjustments and/or the details for historical sale transactions only.  Transactions entered here will not affect the general ledger account balances, and can be entered as individual transactions, or as lump sum amounts.  For example, if you are starting to use Constellation1 Accounting in the middle of the year, say August, you can use a historical sale to enter a single transaction that defines transaction totals from January 1st through July 31st for each calendar agent, or for any anniversary period.  These historical values will then populate the **Earnings Summaries** in the agent's profile record and ensure that the agent is paid correctly going forward. 

A historical sale can also be used to move sales activity from one agent record to another, in cases where an agent changes their tax ID number mid-year.  It is also useful in instances where an agent would like to pre-pay Office$.    

To enter a historical sale, go to **Sales > Processing > Sale Transactions** and select the **Historical** radio button.

You will receive the following pop-up:

On the Commission tab, select the agent by clicking on the green plus sign.  At a minimum, fill in all fields that are pertinent to the agent's commission calculation.  For example, if the agent's commission basis is Office$, then enter a positive office dollar, equal to the amount the agent has already paid in their current or future commission period.  During this step, you will also want to make certain to zero out any default values that populate in the record, that are not needed.  Keep in mind that historical sales do not need to balance; nothing in a historical sale hits the GL, its only purpose is to boost or reduce relevant values for agents.  

Enter **Class** and **Date Paid**, before saving the record.  Note:  The **Closed** date, **Payment Received** date and **Date Paid** all need to be within the agent's commission period.

Note:  If an agent changes tax ID numbers mid-year, you can use a historical sale to move pertinent commission values from one agent profile record to another.  To do this, on the **Commission** tab, add two agent commission records.  Enter negative values in fields that are pertinent to the agent's commission calculation, on the first agent commission record, and enter positive values on the second agent record. For example, if the agent's commission basis is Office$ then enter negative office dollar for the first agent and positive office dollar for the second agent record.  Doing this will move office dollars from the first agent to the second agent and will also move 1099 activity from one agent to the other.
