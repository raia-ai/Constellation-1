# Accounting - Reason for ‘Edits Disallowed’ Pop-up

The purpose of this article is to provide you with some information relating to "Edits Disallowed" pop-up warning.

Only one user is permitted to issue checks, from any module, at one time.  This applies to voiding agent checks in the sales module too.  If the application detects that another user is printing checks, or voiding an agent’s check, you will receive the following pop-up:

There is no way to tell if another user is actively printing checks, or voiding agent checks, it is only possible to tell if another user has a tab open that would allow them to issue checks or void agent checks.

See further details below regarding how each open payment or void tab behaves, for each module:

**Sales Module – Sale Transactions**

With **Issue Commission Payments** tab open, you can **Add**, **Edit**, **Copy**, or **Delete** sales, if you have not already clicked on the **Re-calculate Splits and Agent Charges** button. As seen below, the **Re-calculate Splits and Agent Charges** button is still enabled.

In this case, the **Add** button is still enabled when in the **Pending** view of the **Sale Transactions:**

And also, the **Edit**, **Copy**, and **Delete** buttons are still enabled in the **Closed** view of a **Sale Transaction**.

Once you have clicked the **Re-calculate Splits and Agent Charges** button, notice that the **Re-calculate Splits and Agent Charges** button is disabled:

At this point, you are no longer able to **Add**, **Edit**, **Copy**, or **Delete** a **Pending** sale because all buttons are disabled:

And you are unable to **Add**, **Edit**, **Copy**, **or Void** a **Closed** sale because those buttons are also disabled:

Note:  With the **Void Commission Payments** tab open, you are also unable to **Add**, **Edit**, **Copy**, **Delete, or Void Pending** or **Closed** sales.

**Sales Module – Trust Transactions**  

With the **Issue Trust Checks** tab open, you cannot **Add**, **Edit**, **Copy**, **Delete**, or **Save** **Trust** **Transactions**.

**Accounts Payable Module**

With **Pay Bills** tab open, you will not be able to **Add**, **Edit**, **Copy**, or **Delete**, AP **Bills**.

**Note**:  If you receive the **Edits Disallowed** pop-up and you do not have any of the payment or void tabs open, then you have a locked check run and will need to go to **System**\>>**Processing**\>>**Reset Check Run**. The user session that caused the check run to lock will be listed and you will need to check with that user to make sure they are not currently issuing or voiding checks.  If they are not, then click the **Reset Cash Account Check Run** and/or **Reset Trust Account Check Run** if applicable.
