# REALedger - Re-Summarize G/L Balances for Financial Statements

There may be situations in which you need to re-summarize GL balances at a point in time that does not coincide with the end of your fiscal year; most commonly, this can occur when your fiscal year does not align with the calendar year. To re-summarize your GL in REALedger, navigate to **System > Maintenance > Re-Summarize G/L for Financial Statements**:

Enter a Starting Date that aligns with the **start of the period** you wish to re-summarize

Enter Ending Date that aligns with the **end of the period** you wish to re-summarize

Check both the **Re-Create Balance Forward Records** and **Summarize Fiscal Year Transactions** boxes.

Click **Process**

This process can be repeated for multiple periods as needed. If you are re-summarizing multiple periods, we recommend starting with the earliest period, then moving forward in time.
