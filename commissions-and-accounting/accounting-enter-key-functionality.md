# Accounting - Enter Key Functionality

The purpose of this article is to make users aware of how the **Enter** key can be used in place of the **Tab** key throughout the program and point out some differences to expect when using the **Enter** key versus the **Tab** key. &#x20;

Windows dialog (pop-up) messages:  When the **Enter** key is pressed on a Windows dialog box, the behavior is the same as it has been, which means pressing the **Enter** key on a dialog box will produce the same results as clicking **Yes**.  For example:  If a dialog pop-up displays "Yes" and "No" buttons and "Yes" is the default (shown as thicker border around the button) then pressing **Enter** will produce the same result as clicking "Yes."

Buttons: Some views have buttons within their navigation lists and within their detail area.  For example:  The view **GL > Processing > Budget** has the **Create Budget from Previous Year** button in the navigation list:

And the **Copy To All Months** button in the record details:

Both of these buttons are reachable via **Tab** so therefore they are also now reachable via **Enter**.  However, there is a difference between **Tab** and **Enter** when you land on the buttons.  Pressing **Tab** will move focus to the next control, whereas pressing **Enter** will have the same effect as clicking the button.&#x20;

Note:  When a button has the focus, it will have a faint dotted line around it.
