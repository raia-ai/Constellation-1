# Accounting - GL Activity when AP Bill and AP Payment Cross Months

The purpose of this article is to show how GL activity is affected when entering an AP bill with an invoice date in a different period than the payment date of the bill. 

The **Invoice Date** in **Bills** is what determines when the expense hits the GL.  So, if a bill has an **Invoice Date** in March and the **Date Paid** is in April, then that is okay, as long as the check is issued in April.  The example below, shows what happens in the GL, when entering and paying a bill.   

In the screenshot below, the bill has an Invoice date of 03/31/2023:

So, regardless of what day the bill is paid, the expense remains in March.
