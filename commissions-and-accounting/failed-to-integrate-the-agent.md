*   This occurs if the agent had already been added to QuickBooks to invoice for upfront fees.
*   There is naming schema that must be adhered to; the Customer Name must be Lastname, Firstname. (there is a dot at the end of the name) and the Vendor Name must be Lastname, Firstname (no dot at end of name)
*   To fix the error, ensure the Customer Name in QuickBooks® displays as per screen shots below depending if the agent is transacting as an Individual or Company. 
*   Once the Customer Name is edited, you can select Integrate to Accounting button again, and the Vendor Name will be created for you automatically.
