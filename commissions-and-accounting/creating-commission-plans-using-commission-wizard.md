# Creating Commission Plans Using Commission Wizard

This article will serve as a reference for creating new Commission Plans when using the Commissions Wizard.

The wizard will guide the user through the process to create a new commission plan using the Commissions Wizard.

Note: The wizard is enabled by default. To create commission plans manually, the wizard can be disabled in System Settings / Advanced Settings.

To create a plan:

*   Select Commissions from the left hand navigation bar
*   Select the **Add+** button

On the first screen,

*   Define a name for the new plan
*   Select the commission basis for the plan
*   Select Flat Rate or Sliding Scale
    *   Flat Rate will allow you to define the rate of the commission plan in dollars or as a percentage and all fields will be "greyed out"
    *   Sliding Scale will allow you to create a tiered commission plan and define the rate of the commission plan in dollars or as a percentage up to a maximum of two tiers.
    *   For plans in excess of two tiers, turn off the wizard and add manually or it can be edited after to incorporate extra tiers
    *   For Sliding Scale, make your selections for Calculate Agent History Using, Period Starting from and Period Ending and Commission Basis Date
*   Select **Next**
