At this point you can select the agent you wish to send docs to and select Agent Commission Statement and/or Transaction Record Sheet as well as the appropriate Template type, Custom (C) or Master (M) and select **Send** at which point they will be emailed to the agent(s) selected

You can also download a copy by selecting the download icon to the right of the Template Type.

**Note**: Should an agent be on both sides of the transaction, rather than sending separate documents, you can toggle on "Combine Same Agent in One File" and a combined document will be sent to the agent(s)
