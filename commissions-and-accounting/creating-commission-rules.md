Commission Rules based on sliding scale

For regions where commissions are calculated using the sale price of a transaction on a sliding scale, like the province of British Columbia, tiers can be established similar to below:

For example, if the sale price of a transaction was $8,000,000.00 and the Commission Rule in the screen shot below was used for the Selling Side of commission only the calculations will be as follows:

1\. $2,000,000.00 x 3% = $60,000.00

2\. $5,500,000.00 x 2% = $110,000.00

3\. $500,000.00 x 1% = $5,000.00

Total Commission on the Selling Side would be $175,000.00
