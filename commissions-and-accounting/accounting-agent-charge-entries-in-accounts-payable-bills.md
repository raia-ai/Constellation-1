# Accounting - Agent Charge Entries in Accounts Payable Bills

The purpose of this article is to outline the benefits of using the **Agent Charge Entries** sub-form in accounts payable bills. &#x20;

There are two sub-forms within an accounts payable bill, the **Check Expense Entries** and the **Agent Charge Entries**.  The **Check Expense Entries** section is where you will enter the details of expenses for the company.  The **Agent Charge Entries** section is where you can enter payments being made on behalf of agents.  The benefit of using the **Agent Charge Entries** section, when purchasing supplies on behalf of an agent, is that an agent charge will be created for the agent automatically upon saving the bill.   &#x20;

In the example below, $1000 was paid to Sign Posts Inc. for signs.  The office will be keeping a portion of the signs totaling $600 and two agents are each going to be given signs valued at $200 for each agent.  In this instance, you will enter $1000 in the **Amount** field, $600 in the **Check Expense Entries** sub-form and add the two agents in the **Agent Charge Entries** sub-form with **Amount** of $200 for each agent.&#x20;
