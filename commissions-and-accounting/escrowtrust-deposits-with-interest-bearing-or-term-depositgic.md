# Escrow/Trust Deposits with Interest Bearing or Term Deposit/GIC

Should your organization hold escrow/trust funds in an interest bearing account or hold these funds in some form of term deposit/GIC, it is possible to track it as such in Commissions Online.

**Adding a deposit to an Interest Bearing Account**

Navigate to the transaction in question and add your deposit as usual. 

*   See [Adding Trust/Escrow Deposits (Held By My Company OR Others)](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/knowledgeBase/16238438) or [Entering a Trust Deposit, Disbursements, and Transfers (Video)](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/knowledgeBase/22100682) for reference purposes

From the Deposit Interest dropdown box, select **Interest Bearing** and enter Interest Payable To, Interest Rate, Interest Earned, Interest Paid and the Processing Fee.

Interest Retained will be calculated automatically for you.  Please note that Processing Fee Tax will calculate automatically for you if your company has Tax enabled

![](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/api/attachments/action/1/a1a50136-6fbb-45b9-86d7-41e6d947df34) Add your deposit as usual but from the Deposit Interest dropdown, select Term Deposit/GIC and enter the appropriate fields as like the Interest Bearing account before

Once the funds have been physically converted to a Term Deposit/GIC through your financial institution, under Actions to the right of the original deposit in question, select Issue Term Deposit

Enter the date the Term deposit/GIC was created and appropriate Term Deposit GIC Number, adding comment as needed and select Save

By default, the system will assign the full deposit amount to the Term Deposit/GIC

**Redeeming a Term Deposit/GIC prior to closing transaction**

Navigate to transaction in question and from Details tab go to Deposits

Under Actions on right hand side of Term Deposit/GIC you wish to redeem, select Redeem Term Deposit

![](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/api/attachments/action/1/652e3c2c-2e1e-4e43-90be-ee07f43ac876)

Enter the date the Term Deposit/GIC was redeemed, enter comments as required and select Save and Post

The funds will then be transferred back to the Trust account so that the transaction can be closed as usual

If an incorrect Term Deposit Issued or Term Deposit Redeemed date was entered, it can be edited in Commissions Online by selecting **Edit** via the ellipsis in the **Actions** column to the far right of the Term Deposit Issued or Term Deposit Redeemed entry.

**_Please note, this will only change the date in Commissions Online. If changes are required to your Accounting application, you will need to manually edit that date too._**
