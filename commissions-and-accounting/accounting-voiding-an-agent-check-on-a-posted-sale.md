# Accounting - Voiding an Agent Check on a Posted Sale

The purpose of this article is to show what happens in the sales module when you void an agent check from a posted sale.

When you void a check on a sale that has already posted to the GL, a new _closed_ sale is created where the **Gross Revenue** and **Deposits** are $0.00.

The **Agent Commissions** record will contain all negative values to reverse the original check.&#x20;

Add another agent record in the sale and re-distribute the commission appropriately.
