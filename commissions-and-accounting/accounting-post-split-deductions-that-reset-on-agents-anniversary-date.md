# Accounting - Post-split Deductions that Reset on Agent's Anniversary Date

This article will provide you with a workaround for how to reset a post-split deduction that caps out mid-year, rather than resetting at the beginning of the calendar year. 

By default, all post-split deductions will reset on January 1st.  However, if you would like for a post-split to reset on any other mid-year date, then you can check the **Anniv Reset?** box, when setting up the post-split deduction record. 

In the example below, the TRANS post-split deduction needs to reset on May 1st, as opposed to January 1st.

If the TRANS post-split deduction needs to reset on May 1st, instead of January 1st, the **Anniv Reset?** box should be checked.

... and each agent will need to have a contract date of May 1st as well.

The agent can still have a Calendar Year Commission Period, so their commission calculations are correct.
