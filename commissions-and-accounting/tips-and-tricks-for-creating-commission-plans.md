The brokerage has asked you to assign a new commission plan that has not already been created it's a brand new agreement.

A few things to be aware of:

*   The plan name cannot be more than 6 characters.
*   More can be added in the description area.
*   Be sure to select the correct Commission Calculation type, Closed is usually the standard but there are many other options according to the Brokerage's business model.
*   Next the Commission Basis, if a tiered plan what is the basis for that figure?
*   Below is an example of what a tiered commission plan should look like.

*   Notice that once the agent is capped the next line will be what level they remain at for the duration of the plan period.
*   The same is true for the other fees.
