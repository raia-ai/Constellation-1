# Accounting - Purpose of the "1099 Address" checkbox in vendor profile records.

The purpose of this article is to explain the purpose of the **1099 Address** checkbox, in a vendor's profile record.  

In vendor profile records, there is a checkbox labeled **1099 Address**.  This box should only be used in instances when there are multiple vendor profile records, that reference the same Tax ID number, but there are different addresses referenced in two or more vendor profile records.  Placing a checkmark in this box signifies that the address referenced in this vendor's profile record will appear on the 1099 form, with the combined total of all vendors with the same Tax ID number. 

Only check this box when it is really needed.  If it is checked unnecessarily, it will take longer to generate 1099 records.
