# Creating a New Commission Plan

An agent has renegotiated their compensation plan with the brokerage, and there is not a commission plan already in place. After following the below steps be sure to assign the plan to the agent under the commissions tab of the agent profile. If this particular agent has any pending transactions, the next step is to Recalculate Open Transactions, under the Accounting menu.

Navigate to the blue tool bar and click on Commissions.

*   Start New
*   Plan name can be up to 6 characters with a more detailed explanation in the description.
*   Begin by selecting the Commission Calculation Type, typically based on closed to Today's date, unless it is a rolling plans or based on other criteria.
*   Next the Commission Basis- this would be what the tiers or levels may be based on, for a flat percentage and no levels the Adjusted Gross Less of the top fees would be your basic basis for the calculations.
*   If a tiered plan enter the amounts needed to reach next level AND/OR or if based on number of ends, or if the flat rate is to the office it will be a negative amount.
*   C1 Commissions supports up to 13 levels.
*   Enter the appropriate values in either the percentage or the number of ends.
*   Continue down the levels if required.
