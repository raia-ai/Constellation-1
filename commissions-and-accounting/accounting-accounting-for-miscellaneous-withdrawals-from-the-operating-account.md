# Accounting - Accounting for Miscellaneous Withdrawals from the Operating Account

The purpose of this article is to provide suggestions on how to account for miscellaneous withdrawals from the operating cash account.

Occasionally, when reconciling the operating cash account, you may find that the bank has charged you for incidentals like wire fees, NSF fees, checks, or deposit slips. You can account for these charges in one of two ways:

1.  Create a journal entry
2.  Enter a manual bill

To create a journal entry, go to **General Ledger > Processing > General Journal Entries**

*   Click **Add**
*   Enter a unique **Journal Entry Number**
*   Enter **Description**
*   Enter **Date** the withdrawal was made
*   Enter **Amount** of the charge
*   Click the green plus sign twice, to the right of the **Journal Entry Lines** label, to account for the **Debit** and **Credit** side of the journal entry
    *   On the first line item, enter the amount of the withdrawal in the **Debit** column and code this to an expense account. In the screenshot below, we have coded the withdrawal to Bank Fees.
    *   On the second line item, enter the amount of the withdrawal in the **Credit** column and code this to the cash account that the charge was deducted from
*   When the journal entry is in balance, click **Save**

You will know when the journal entry is in balance when you see a Remaining balance of $0.00.

See below for a sample journal entry to account for incidental bank charges.

*   Click on the **Manual** radio button
*   Click **Add**

*   Enter **Date Paid** to reflect the date of the withdrawal
*   Enter meaningful description of the withdrawal in the **Internal Comments** field
*   Enter **Amount**
*   Select the **Debit Transaction** box to create a unique **Check Number**
*   Click the green plus sign, to the right of the **Check Expense Entries** label
*   **Amount** will autofill
*   Select the **Account** from the dropdown
*   Select the **Office** from the dropdown
*   Select **Project** from dropdown, if applicable
*   Entering **Comment** is optional
*   Click **Save**

See below for a sample manual bill to account for incidental bank charges.
