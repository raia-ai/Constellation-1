# Accounting - Adjusting Print Coordinates For 1099 Forms

To adjust the placement of values on the 1099 forms, first navigate to **Agents > Processing > 1099s**, then follow the steps below.  

*   Navigate to the **1099-MISC** **Printing Layout** tab.
*   Click **Edit**, then **Reset to Defaults**.
*   Click **Print Test** to generate a test 1099 form.
    *   Check to see that all values print into each box correctly, either by printing to a 1099-MISC form or to blank paper and check alignment.
    *   Edit each field as needed, using the X and Y coordinate values.  If all fields need to shift up, down, left or right, use **Shift all.** 

*   The same steps as seen above can be repeated in the **1099-NEC Printing Layout** tab as required.

## Adjusting Vertical Placement of Data

When printing 1099s, if you find that the values, on the top 1099, print in the boxes correctly, but the values in the remaining 1099s print too high or too low, you can edit the vertical adjustment between the forms by navigating to **Agents > Processing > 1099s**, then follow the steps below. 

*   Navigate to the **1099-MISC Printing Layout** tab. 
    *   Click **Edit**.
    *   Edit the number in the **Vertical adjustment between top and bottom 1099** field.
        *   If the field values need to print higher, decrease the number value.
        *   If the field values need to print lower, increase the value. 
    *   After making the adjustment, click **Save**.
    *   Click the **Print Test** button. 
    *   Print the test page to blank paper and hold up to a 1099-MISC form, to check alignment.  
    *   If the alignment is good, then print the 1099-MISC forms.  
*   Navigate to the **1099-NEC Printing Layout** tab. 
    *   Click **Edit**.
    *   Edit the number in the **Vertical adjustment between 1099s on same page** field.
        *   If the field values need to print higher, decrease the number value.
        *   If the field values need to print lower, increase the value. 
    *   After making the adjustment, click **Save**.
    *   Click the **Print Test** button. 
    *   Print the test page to blank paper and hold up to a 1099-NEC form, to check alignment.  
    *   If the alignment is good, then print the 1099-NEC forms.
