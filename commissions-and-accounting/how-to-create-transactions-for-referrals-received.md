 **Main Tab :**

*   We recommend that you enter as a Buying side transaction.
*   This allows you to attach the Referring Brokerage as the Selling Brokerage to generate any applicable letters you should require. 
*   All data must be completed as usual with the following exceptions: If Buyer or Seller information is not available we suggest a place holder of Unknown or a common name "Doe, Smith. ect.)
*   On the Main tab, select " R: Referral" from the Transaction Type drop down 

**On the Commission tab:** 

*   Select a commission rule that gives 0% to the Selling side, and any percentage on the Buying side that will be overwritten 
*   Override the Gross Commission to the gross amount of the referral you are receiving; excluding taxes if applicable 
*   Select/enter the brokerage that is paying the referral as the Selling side of the Referral Transaction
