# Accounting - ACH Payment Error - Adjusting Imbalances Between Transaction and Agent Payment

The purpose of this article is to provide one option to account for agent payment ACH transfer errors.

If you discover, when reconciling your cash account, that the amount transferred to an agent via ACH differs from the payment amount referenced in a sales transaction, for example, an agent was supposed to be paid $8,692.50 via ACH, however, when entering the ACH payment at the bank, the amount transferred was short $90; using the steps below will help correct the problem and allow you to complete your bank reconciliation, without making any edits to the sales transaction.  

*   First of all, pay the agent, $90 via ACH, as soon as possible.
*   Next, add a journal entry, dated the same day the incorrect ACH transfer cleared the bank.  
    *   Note, the journal entry should Debit and Credit the cash account.

*   Then, in the bank reconciliation, clear the $8,692.50 with the $90 Debit side of the journal entry; they net to the amount that cleared the bank. 

Later when completing the bank reconciliation, for the month the additional $90 was transferred to the agent, clear the Credit side of the journal entry. 

Note:  This process will work in situations when the agent received ACH funds in excess of the payment amount referenced in the sales transaction.  Only in this case, when completing the bank reconciliation, that the error was discovered, you will clear the Credit side of the journal entry, with the payment amount referenced in the sale; they will net to the amount that cleared the bank.  In this scenario, you will transfer $90 out of the agent's account, into your operating account.  Then later, when completing the bank reconciliation, for the month the $90 was transferred from the agent's account into your operating account, clear the Dredit side of the journal entry.
