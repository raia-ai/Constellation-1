Select the Workstation Cleanup button

*   Once selected, you will receive a confirmation prompt, "This will reset the registered workstation(s) and may cause loss of data being edited. Do you want to continue?" Select **Yes**
*   Once the Cleanup is completed, you will be presented with System Confirmation window, select **Yes** and close the quick!TRS Administrative Utility application.
*   You may now launch the Commissions application.

_Please note:_ _This functionality forces all registered workstations through a clean up process, meaning if your computer crashed with Commissions open, the program may be using one of your licenses, causing other users the inability to launch the program from another workstation._ _It will remove all the registered workstations from the licensing system. This may cause current users that are logged in to quit Commissions without any warning that can result in loss of data._
