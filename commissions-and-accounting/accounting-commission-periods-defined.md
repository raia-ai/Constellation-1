# Accounting - Commission Periods Defined

The purpose of this article is to define the commission period options available from the dropdown in the agent's profile record.  

When adding a new agent profile record, if you will be assigning a **Commission Plan** to the agent's profile record, you will be required to select a **Commission Period** for the agent.  Note:  If you do not select a **Commission Plan** for the agent, the **Adjusted Gross** commission on the **Commission** tab of the sales transaction will default to 100% for the **Agent $**. 

The **Commission Period** options available are shown in the screenshot below:

Before selecting the agent's **Commission Period**, review the definitions for each option below:  

**Anniversary Year** - This option will accumulate earnings for 1 year, the start of which is defined in the Contract Start Date field on the Personal tab of the agent's profile record.  The Period Length default is 1 year and cannot be modified.

**Calendar Year** - This option will accumulate earnings for the current calendar year (starting on January 1 and ending on December 31).  The Period Length default is 1 year and cannot be modified.

**Rolling Years** - This option will accumulate earnings based on the number of rolling years referenced in the Period Length field, of the agent's profile record.  

**Rolling Days** - This option will accumulate earnings based on the number of days, referenced in the Period Length field, of the agent's profile record, _including today_.   For example, if today is 04/05/2023 and the Period Length is 365 days, the commission calculation is based on sales paid between 04/05/2022 - 04/05/2023.  

**Rolling Full Months Including Current Month** - This option will accumulate earnings based on the number of months referenced in the Period Length field of the agent's profile record, _including_ the current month.  For example, if today is 04/05/2023 and the Period Length is 12 months, the commission calculation is based on sales paid between 05/01/2022 and 04/05/2023.

**Rolling Full Months Excluding Current Month** \- This option will accumulate earnings based on the number of months referenced in the Period Length field of the agent's profile record, _excluding_ the current month.  For example, if today is 04/05/2023 and the Period Length is 12 months, the commission calculation is based on sales paid between 04/01/2022 - 03/31/2023.

**Rolling Full Months Including Current Month If Past 15th** - This option will accumulate earnings based on the number of months referenced in the Period Length field of the agent's profile record, _including_ the current month if the current date is past the 15th of the month.  For example, if today is 04/05/2023 and the Period Length is 12 months, the commission calculation is based on sales closed between 04/01/2022 - 03/31/2023.  If today is 04/16/2023, the commission calculation is based on sales paid between 05/01/2022 - 04/16/2023.

**Rolling Full Quarters Including Current Quarter** - This option will accumulate earnings based on the number of quarters referenced in the Period Length field of the agent's profile record, _including_ the current quarter.  For example, if today is 04/05/2023 and the Period Length is 4 quarters, the commission calculation is based on sales paid between 07/01/2022 - 04/05/2023.

**Rolling Full Quarters Excluding Current Quarter** - This option will accumulate earnings based on the number of quarters referenced in the Period Length field of the agent's profile record, _excluding_ the current quarter.  For example, if today is 04/05/2023 and the Period Length is 4 quarters, the commission calculation is based on sales paid between 04/01/2022 - 03/31/2023.

**Rolling Full Years Including Current Year** \- This option will accumulate earnings based on the number of years, referenced in the Period Length field of the agent's profile record, _including_ the current year.
