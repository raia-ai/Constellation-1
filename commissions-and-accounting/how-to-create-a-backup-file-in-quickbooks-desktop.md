This article outlines how to create a manual backup file for QuickBooks® Desktop versions. We recommend regular backups of your QuickBooks® company files to ensure a recent copy of your critical accounting records should a data loss occur. QuickBooks® makes this easy with options for setting the reminder frequency for backups, verifying data integrity and scheduling backups at set intervals.
