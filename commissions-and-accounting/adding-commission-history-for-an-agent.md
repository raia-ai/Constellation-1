# Adding Commission History for an Agent

The purpose of this article is to provide direction should you need to attach commission history from one agent to another (agent recently registered to transact as a Personal Real Estate Corporation) OR if you changed applications mid-calendar year.

*   On the left sidebar, select Agents / Summary Tab and select **EDIT**
*   Expand the Agent History panel and select **ADD** icon; date will default to todays’ date and can be edited to a date that is more meaning to yourself.
*   If you are adding history for a rolling type commission plan be sure to select the correct date and save one entry at at time. To add another line of history for another month, select **ADD** icon and ensure you are working on the empty record vs the one(s) already created.
