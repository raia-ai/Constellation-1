# Accounting - Processing Commissions Deposited Prior to Sale Closing Month

The purpose of this article is to provide a couple of options for accounting for commission deposits that were received and deposited in a different month than the sale is projected to close, and agent checks are issued.   

**Method 1:**

*   The first method would be to enter the commission deposit in the sale, as you normally do:

*   Then enter a journal entry, dated in the month the deposit was made at the bank.  The proposed journal entry would debit and credit the cash account:

*   Then when reconciling the cash account, for the month prior to the sale closing, clear the Debit side of the journal entry, leaving the Credit side uncleared.  Then when the sale closes the next month, the deposit from the sale will retrieve into the bank rec as a Debit and you can clear that with the Credit side of the journal entry, they net to zero.  

**Method 2:**

*   The second method, would require a non-commission deposit, dated the day the deposit was made at the bank:

*   It would also require a negative pass-through on the Third-Party tab of the sale, making sure to use the same GL account used in the non-commission deposit:

*   Using this method, you would omit the deposit on the Commission tab of the sale:
