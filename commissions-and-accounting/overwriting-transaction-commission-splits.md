*   **Flat amount, or other percentages**

Override the Adjusted Agent portion, or Adjusted Broker portion as you will see they are in blue. If the Shared or Unshared income is to be different this is where you would make that adjustment.

*   **Multiple agents on an End**

It’s important to note that you only need to overwrite the secondary agent first and the primary agent’s calculation will then occur.

If it is a percentage; overwrite here.
