# Website Admin > Photo Editor Error

Are you attempting to upload images to a listing that already has images from an MLS board? The system does not allow this functionality due to legal agreements with MLS boards from preventing images being edited from the MLS boards once downloaded from them. If the listing has 0 images the Photo Editor can be used to add images to the listing, but not if images are already provided for the listing from the MLS.

The UX is poor however with it just throwing an error with no explanation as to why. The Constellation1 Website Product team is aware of this poor experience and is currently discussing options for changing how this functionality displays the error message to be more user friendly. 

This was discussed on the Thursday support call with Will and Chantal on Thursday. In an effort to make sure information is more available to all HSF reps for this kind of information I will mark this response as a Knowledge Base article so it can be referenced by CST members in the future.
