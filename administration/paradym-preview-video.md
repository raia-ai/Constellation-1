**To customize the graphics within Preview Video (Step 6 - 10)**

Step 7: The graphics and scenes already in place for you are general graphic placeholders. You are welcome to use the existing graphic placeholders that have been preset for you already. However, if you'd like to swap any of the three scenes as mentioned above with graphics of your own, locate and select the appropriate "Replace" option under the scene you wish to change and swap out. See image above.

Step 8: As mentioned in Step 7, select the scene of choose you wish to customize and swap out for a graphic of your own, select "Replace." Next, you will see a place where you can upload your own graphic. Select "Choose File" > Continue > Once you have uploaded the image select "Save" at the top right of your screen.

Step 9: Quick Tip: If you are having trouble getting the file to upload, try a larger graphic file to upload.  Notice the recommended file size of 1080 X1080. If you continue to have issues, please give us a call as mentioned in the image above 1-800-873-0700 option 1 or by email [graphics@paradym.com](mailto:graphics@paradym.com)

Step 10: Quick Tip: Notice that when you swap out the graphics for either the "Address Scene" or the "Agent Branding Scene" - The verbiage description labels will NOT disappear. Those are general descriptions that do not get replaced when uploading your new graphic. They are standard and can not be overwrite with the new image. Only the background and bottom section will be replaced. Keep that in mind when customizing and adding a graphic of your own for both of those scenes.

**How to share Preview Video to Social Media Platforms (Steps 11 - 16)**

Step 11: Be sure you have enabled "Preview Video" in Step 5 before moving forward.  Next, locate and select your name at the top right for a drop down menu > select "Settings"

Step 12: Select "Connections" from the vertical menu of options on the left side of your screen.  Then select the GEAR option to the right side of the social media platform you would like to share your Preview Video too.   Let's first explore the option if you'd like Paradym to share your Preview Video for you automatically to social media.

Step 13: If you prefer to automatically share JUST your Preview Video to that social media outlet, select the option for just "Preview Video" as referenced in the above image. Or, if you prefer that Paradym share BOTH your Visual Tour and your Preview Video to your social media outlet automatically, select the option for "Both" as referenced in the image above. Select "Save"

NOTE: If the option for both has been selected, Paradym will automatically share your Preview Video first followed by the Visual Tour 48 hours later. This lag time is intentional so that we do not post your tour and your preview video back to back automatically onto your social platform.  Although, if you prefer to keep the same Visual Tour setting for the automation piece to your social outlet, there is also a way to manually share it as well. see next steps

Step 14: To manually share your Preview Video to social media, select your name at the top right for a drop down menu, then select the "My Tours" option.

Step 15: Select the "Listing" of Choice by clicking on the address. Locate on the left side a menu of options for your listing. You should be on the listing menu screen. see next image below the following instructions.

Purple arrow - Click on the Preview Video link to see an example of the it for this listing \*\*\*\*\*\*\*  If you do not see this option.. please see step 16

Red arrow - Click on the Social Media icon below of choice you wish to share your Preview Video (located below the tour sharing social media icons.. be sure you are under the area Preview Video). In your next pop up screen, be sure to uncheck/unselect any social media you do not wish to share with.   Type in a comment you would like for when we share it to social media. The comment is customer facing on Social Media. The comment is used to describe what you are sharing. i.e. attention grabber, description, details, snap shot, teaser info of the property. It will appear above the Preview Video and goes with it as it is shared to your social media outlets. 

Instagram sharing - Click on the Instagram icon separately and follow steps to share to Instagram.  \*\* There is actually a Separate KB article walking through those steps if you wish to receive help on those steps. 

Yellow arrow - Click the 'trash can" icon if you wish to delete the current video. You can always create a new video if you wish in case you have added newer photos since the Video has been created.

Step 16: Referencing Step 15 above, if you do NOT see options as referencing in the image above to share your Preview Video to social media, please continue with this step. Quick Tip, this means your video has not been created yet. In fact, you will see an option to "Create Preview Video" as referencing in the image below.  Continue by Clicking on the option to "Create Preview Video." A pop up notification will appear with a spinning wheel letting you know your request is being processed. Please wait a minute, then "refresh" your page. Continue repeating this until you see that the video has been created for you. Afterwards.. please reference Step 15 mentioned above.
