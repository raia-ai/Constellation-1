# Bulk Send | Constellation1 Customer Hub

Bulk Send allows users to automate the process of sending a standard document to multiple signers simultaneously. During the Session Draft, user uploads a CSV (Bulk List) file containing the names and email addresses of all signers. A separate Session is created for each signer on that list. When a user sends that Bulk Send out, each recipient from the Bulk List receives their own document to sign. This tool is particularly useful for Brokers, Agents, and Administrators who need to quickly send out common documents for signatures. Each Bulk Send allows users to send up to 100 Sessions.

**Note:** This feature is only available to eSign Enterprise Clients and is not available to single user accounts.

Using Bulk Send in eSign:

**Managing Bulk Sessions:**

Users also have the ability to monitor the Status of Bulk Send Sessions. To access Session history of a Bulk Send, navigate to Bulk Send, which gives a list of all Bulk Send Sessions. Here, the user can choose to either, View Sessions (view the details of all individual Sessions inside that specific Bulk Send) or View Details (view the combined history of that Bulk Send).
