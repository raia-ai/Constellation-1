YouTube Overview 

This article will be covering an overview of YouTube and Paradym. This includes connecting your channel, what each option does, and some helpful tips.

So, you want to connect a YouTube channel to share your tour videos automatically.   
You have come to the right place. Let's get started on the basics first. 

Once you are signed into your Paradym account, click on your name in the upper right and hit **Settings**.   
In Settings, you will see a box labeled as **Social Connections**.

You cannot connect your social media here. This is only an overview of your connections.   
It shows not only what connections we have to offer, but whether or not you have a connection established, nothing established or need to reconnect. 

In the photo above, you will notice both **Facebook** and **YouTube (Unbranded)** show an **empty circle** to the right of them.  
This means there is no connection established whatsoever but you can connect one, if you desire. 

The **Twitter** and **YouTube** options show a **green check mark** in the circle to the right. This means they are connected. 

**LinkedIn** shows a **red exclamation**, which means a reconnection needs to be done.

To connect or reconnect one of your social media sites, you can either click **Change** (just as shown on the photo above) or **Connections** on the left hand column.

The next page will appear as follows in the photo below.

You will now notice not circles but plus signs and gears.   
The gears mean there is a connection established.   
The gear with the red exclamation means a reconnection must be done.   
The plus sign means there is no connection and you can connect, if desired.

Below you will see a photo with multiple arrows pointing to certain items. Each of those arrows will be covered.

The **Purple Arrow** will show the channel name that you connected with Paradym.   
If you see an email address instead of a name, the likelihood of you not having a channel is high. 

The **Red Arrows** show the options Reconnect and Disconnect.  
Reconnect only needs to be used if you have an expired token or another reason of why the connection is no longer established, needing to be refreshed.   
Disconnect is available if you need to completely remove the social media site from Paradym. 

The **Teal Arrow** shows the option, "Delete My Videos For Sold Tours."  
A common question about this option is why should it be checked.   
The reason this option is available is because if a customer purchases a home and the video of the tour is still on YouTube, this can pose a security risk as their home layout is available for anyone to view. Some brokerages will require you to have this option turned on, so once your tour/listing is no longer active, the YouTube video will be deleted. 

The **Yellow Arrow** points to a box that says, "Use Tour Cover Photo of YouTube Video Thumbnail."  
Cover Photo and Thumbnail. Your Cover Photo is the main photo or the front of the home on the tour. The thumbnail is the small picture that will display on the YouTube option. 

It is highly recommended that you have this box selected, as YouTube could choose a random scene that is undesirable to be the cover photo. Such as the bathroom or a garage. 

(Note, the box showcasing the requirements is necessary to go through, if your YouTube channel has not been verified. You will want to click on the 'link' option in the message in order to go through the verification process.)

The **Navy Arrow** is not a selectable option unless you are connecting with YouTube (Unbranded).   
You will not be able to click this option unless in the Unbranded connection. 

Once the connection is established and the options you desire are selected, click on Save in the upper right.
