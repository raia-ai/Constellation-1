## Release Details

Auto-Create Agent Accounts\
Administrators can now enter a default email address so that agent accounts lacking an email address can still be created automatically. \
This allows agent accounts to be made even when an agent's email is unavailable from the MLS board.

Flyers\
We have streamlined the flyer creation process to make it more user-friendly. \
The New Tour email that agents receive when a new property tour is created now includes a link to "Create a Flyer." This link logs agents into their Paradym account and directs them to the Flyer Builder tool, enabling quick and easy flyer creation.

Bug Fixes \
1\. We fixed an issue with unnecessary text showing on Preview Video email that is sent to agents. \
Previously, the email notifying agents that their preview video was ready contained unnecessary text in the message. \
Now, we’ve removed the unnecessary text from the email message.&#x20;

2\. We fixed an issue with inconsistent line breaks in agents' signatures on their social media. \
Previously, carriage returns would sometimes cause misaligned signature lines on their social media posts.\
Now, we’ve corrected the line break / carriage return issue for a consistent display of the agents’ signature.&#x20;

3\. We fixed an issue where both music and voice narration would not play on newer Apple devices.\
Previously, on newer Apple devices, music would not play when voice narration was added to a property tour.\
Now, we’ve resolved this issue so that now the music plays as expected.

4\. We fixed an issue with a listing’s date and time stamp not showing in the footer of property tours to comply with the IDX rules.\
Previously, the date and time stamp for listings was not displaying in the footer of property tours causing them to violate certain IDX rules.\
Now, we’ve fixed this issue by adding date and time stamps to listing footers to comply with IDX rules.&#x20;

5\. We fixed an issue with the default disclaimer appeared with the agent's customized disclaimer on property tours.\
Previously, the default disclaimer appeared with the agent's customized disclaimer on property tours.\
Now, the agent customized disclaimer will override the default disclaimer.
