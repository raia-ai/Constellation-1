Step 3: You will be asked if you'd like to transfer any tours to an active agent account before deleting permanently. (Hint: will the brokerage keep any remaining active listing tours that you will need to transfer to someone else before deleting the agent account). To continue, you can follow the process provided and simply choose the agent’s account you’d like the tours transferred too. &#x20;

**Keep in mind, once an agent’s profile has been deleted, all of their tours and additional content will be** _**permanently**_ **deleted from the tour list.**&#x20;
