# Constellation1 eSign August 2024 Release Notes

Production Release: August 20, 2024

## Release Summary

**Form Field:** Added option to format the information entered into the form field.   
**Mobile View:** Updates made improved Usability.  
**Bug Fixes**

## Release Details 

Form Field Formatting  
We've updated the Form Field to allow users to apply custom formatting to limit the number of characters and the types of characters that can be entered, minimizing errors when signers enter the required information.   
For instance, zip code fields can be restricted to 5 numeric characters, excluding letters. Similarly, a document policy number field can be limited to a specific number of alphanumeric characters as needed.  
These configuration options help ensure that signers provide the correct information in the proper format, reducing mistakes during the data entry process

Mobile View Updates  
To enhance the mobile experience, we've updated eSign mobile view with several usability improvements for both session creators and signers.  
Updates include,   
The Session page features an improved display of signing sessions, making it easier for a user to navigate their signing sessions.

 Step 1 of the signing session creation process now has a more intuitive workflow. Specifically, when adding a signer, document(s), or other action, the page will remain in its current position rather than jumping back to the top of the page.

Bug Fixes

1\. GPES-4606

We’ve fixed an issue editing a signer when creating a signing session on eSign Mobile.

Previously, when creating a signing session on eSign Mobile, then editing a signer, the Edit menu would continue to display on the Add Recipient screen causing an interruption and adding confusion to the workflow. 

Now, this issue has been resolved. 

  
2\. GPES-4876  
We fixed an issue with using templates when creating a signing session. 

Previously, in some cases, when using a template to create a signing session, the creator was not able to move on to step 2. 

Now, this issue has been corrected.
