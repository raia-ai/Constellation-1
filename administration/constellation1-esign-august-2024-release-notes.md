## Release Details&#x20;

Form Field Formatting\
We've updated the Form Field to allow users to apply custom formatting to limit the number of characters and the types of characters that can be entered, minimizing errors when signers enter the required information. \
For instance, zip code fields can be restricted to 5 numeric characters, excluding letters. Similarly, a document policy number field can be limited to a specific number of alphanumeric characters as needed.\
These configuration options help ensure that signers provide the correct information in the proper format, reducing mistakes during the data entry process

&#x20;Step 1 of the signing session creation process now has a more intuitive workflow. Specifically, when adding a signer, document(s), or other action, the page will remain in its current position rather than jumping back to the top of the page.

Bug Fixes

1\. GPES-4606

We’ve fixed an issue editing a signer when creating a signing session on eSign Mobile.

Previously, when creating a signing session on eSign Mobile, then editing a signer, the Edit menu would continue to display on the Add Recipient screen causing an interruption and adding confusion to the workflow.&#x20;

Now, this issue has been resolved.&#x20;

2\. GPES-4876\
We fixed an issue with using templates when creating a signing session.&#x20;

Previously, in some cases, when using a template to create a signing session, the creator was not able to move on to step 2.&#x20;

Now, this issue has been corrected.
