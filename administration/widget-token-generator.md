# Widget Token Generator | Constellation1 Customer Hub

**Using the Widget Token Generator to place a token in a web page**

The Widget Token Generator (WTG) is a tool to quickly set up and get the token for a widget that you’d like to place on your website. The WTG is available on the content edit page for most content pages and it’s simple to use.  In this example we will call up the WTG while editing the homepage. To activate the Content Designer, click the “+” link:

From the drop down, select the widget that you want to use and click “Get Token…”.

If the widget you’ve selected has configurable options the system will allow you to edit them, as shown below. When you’re done configuring and then click the second “Get Token” button below. The configuration box will close and the widget token will be shown in the box below.

Copy the token code inside the Widget Token box and paste it into the Content Editor below.

You can paste the widget token directly into the content editor even while in “design mode”. There’s no need to change the editor to “HTML mode” to paste the widget.

To test the placement of the widget and to make sure it looks as you expect, you can click the Preview button. Doing so opens up a new window and shows you what your web page will actually look to real website users.

To change the placement of the widget simply remove (cut) the token text and place (paste) it in the new location.

Once you’re happy with the changes submit the changes for approval by clicking the Submit for Approval button or click the Publish button if you have ability to publish directly.

In our example above here is what the final web page looks like:
