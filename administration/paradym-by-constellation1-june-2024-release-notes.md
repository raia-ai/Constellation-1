## Release Details 

NEW! Multi Photo Social Postings

We’ve added the ability for My Tours to post up to 10 photos to social media when a tour is created.

In each of the social media Connection settings, a dropdown menu has been added to the Visual Tour section, allowing the user to select the number of scenes (listing photos) to be posted to social media. 

The default setting has been updated to post 4 photos. Users can change this at anytime by reviewing and editing their social connections.

 Note: X (formerly Twitter) allows posting a maximum of 4 photos per post. 

YouTube Notifications  
We’ve updated the YouTube email notification options. Agents and Brokers can now opt to receive email notifications when YouTube videos are created and ready to post.   
In the Profile section of the user account, under Email Notifications the agent can enable email notifications.

Bug Fixes 

1\. We fixed an issue with mobile target codes.  
Previously, when a mobile target code is set to “unbranded”, the text message sent to the consumer was branded.   
Now, we’ve corrected this issue. When mobile codes are set to unbranded, the text message to the consumer will be unbranded. 

  
2\. We fixed an issue with thumbnail images not showing when blog articles are posted to social media.  
Previously, when a blog article was posted to a social media platform, the thumbnail image was not showing.  
Now, when blog articles are shared on social media, the thumbnail image will show. 

  
3\. We fixed an issue with Auto Tours posting the incorrect status of a property.  
Previously, when a listing status was changed, for example from Active to Pending, the Auto Tour was incorrectly display the status as closed or not available.   
Now, we’ve corrected this issue. Auto tours will display the correct status of the listing when posted to social media.
