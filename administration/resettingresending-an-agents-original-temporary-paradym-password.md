# Resetting/Resending an Agent's Original Temporary Paradym Password

When agent accounts are first set up, a temporary (and admittedly complex) password is assigned and emailed to the agent.

From time to time, an agent might not have that initial email with his or her temporary Paradym password.  Whether it was discarded, misplaced in spam, or "got lost in the mail," there is an easy way for you as the broker to have a new temporary password email sent to the agent.  Note that this article applies only to temporary passwords on new accounts.  If an agent already set up a permanent password and has simply forgotten it, then the agent can use the [forgotten password](https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/?TicketNumber=55706) option to reset his or her own password.

**Warning:** These steps not only issue the email, but they also eliminate the original temporary password to ensure that no one else who might have intercepted it can use it.  To further protect the account, it will eliminate any permanent password that anyone might have set up.   To prevent agents from inadvertently being locked out of their accounts, be sure that the agent really wants a new temporary password before beginning these steps.

1) Log into your main company account (not the agent's account) at [https://my.paradym.com/login](https://my.paradym.com/login)

2) Click the down arrow next to your account name in the upper right, and choose Account Management.

3) Click on the agent who needs a new password.  A magnifying glass search button is available near the top if your agent list is lengthy; or if you have multiple offices, you can click the number to the right of any office to display only agents in that particular office.  In the example below, we have clicked the number 6 on the left to see only the 6 agents in the Pompano office rather than needing to scroll through a lengthy list of over 50 agents.

The agent can then log in with his or her temporary password and will be taken to a screen to select a permanent one.  For more information on temporary passwords, read our article, [Your Initial Temporary Paradym Password](https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/?TicketNumber=57041).
