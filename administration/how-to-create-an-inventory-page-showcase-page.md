Step 2: Next, you will see the general settings for setting up your Showcase Page.

Step 3: Few things you will want to make a decision on as you notice in the image above. The 'Name' of the page should be the first thing you see at the top, "Title."  Next, enter and edit what you'd like the page to be named or called. Note: The title will be visible to your customers. 

Step 4: Continue to scroll down through the General settings page and make your selections such as how you want the page to look. Look for the setting entitled "Default View" -  You've got three choices to choose from. "Gallery" (should be your default setting already set for you as shown in the image above). Or, you can change the "view" to show a "Map" instead of a gallery view of your tours. Or, do you want it to show a "search" menu instead where the customer can do a quick search for what they are looking.  The "Default View" is how you want your customer to search and view your inventory page. 

Step 5: Next, set your Currency Symbol, then set your Status Terms if you wish, and then options on Property Tour History, and whether you allow a filter selection for the customer to toggle between types and status of tours, reference the filter setting at the bottom of the page.  Most of these settings are already set up for you, but you can choose to make any edits and changes as you feel are needed. 

Step 6: When you feel you have made your changes and ready to move forward. Select "Save."  It will redirect you to your settings menu again for your Paradym account.  Locate on the left side menu and select "Showcase" again. Then, select "Preview" that is located near the top right of your page. A new window will pop up giving you a chance to see your new Inventory Page website. To make the window bigger so you can see it better, select the small square (Windows version) in the top right corner of the inventory page window which will open the window to a full screen view. see image below

Step 7: Does it look the way you want?  If not, repeat steps 1 - 6 as mentioned above until you get it the way you want it!

Step 8: Great!  You are finished!  What's next?  Locate the url address (website) at the very top left part of the Inventory Page (see image below)
