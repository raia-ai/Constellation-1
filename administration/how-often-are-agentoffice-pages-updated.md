# How Often Are Agent/Office Pages Updated

The information that appears on Agent and Office profile pages comes from the BOI (and DataPassport for certain areas). We get each type of BOI file 4x each day (early morning, mid morning, afternoon, evening).

Do note that only updated records get sent in the BOI. If someone is concerned that their information is incorrect, their record will need to be triggered so that it gets resent in the BOI. If after the next update their information is still showing off, then their record could be failing to update. Check the BOI Log tool in admin to see if you can find the error yourself and correct. If no luck, reach out to us to look into it further.
