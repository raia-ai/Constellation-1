# How to use the Content Designer

The Content Designer (CD) is a tool that gives you an easy way to create great looking web pages without having to know how to program in HTML. The CD gives a list of widgets from which you can select and place them side by side and build a great looking web page. Some have configuration options like color, size, and font type that allow you to further customize the look & feel of the widget. As you add widgets to your page the CD shows you how they will be laid out and gives you the option re-order them, remove them or edit their settings once more. The CD also provides a preview function so that you can see how the widgets will look exactly on your page.

The CD is available on the content edit page of most content pages but in our example here we will be editing a homepage. To activate the CD, select it from the Content Type options on the content editor page. The Content Designer will show. To begin, select a widget from the drop down and click the “Add Widget…” button.

If the widget you’ve selected has configurable options the system will allow you to edit them, as shown below.

When you’re done configuring and then click the “Add Widget” button. A box representing the widget will be added to the screen. Continue adding and configuring widgets to your heart’s content. To edit a widget that you previously added click the “Edit” link in the box, make your changes and save it. Likewise, to remove a widget from your page click the “Delete” link. Once you’re happy with the changes submit the changes for approval by clicking the Submit for Approval button or click the Publish button if you have ability to publish directly.
