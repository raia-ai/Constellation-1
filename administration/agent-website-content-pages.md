# Agent Website Content Pages | Constellation1 Customer Hub

In web admin, all company website content pages can be found under the Articles section. (Content > Articles)

To help differentiate between company pages and pages intended to be shared for Agent Websites, we name them in the following format: "AW - _Page Name_"

Example - There is a "Buying A Home" page version for the company site and what agent websites link to

Any edits that are made to these "AW" content pages will apply to **ALL agents** as these pages get linked to agents' sites.&#x20;
