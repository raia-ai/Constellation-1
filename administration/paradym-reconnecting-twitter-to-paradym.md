Step 5: You’ll be directed to Twitter and may need to sign in, after which you will need to confirm the on-screen selection to authorize Paradym on your Twitter account.  You will be directed back to the Tour Sharing screen in Paradym you were on previously, meaning the reconnection was successful, **as long as the (!) is now gone.**
