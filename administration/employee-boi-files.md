# Employee BOI Files | Constellation1 Customer Hub

Employees would be those who are Branch Admins or Staff. The Employee BOI file contains a few fields of information for these types of records. 

Here are the current fields that come over in this type of file:

Action|FirstName|LastName|EmployeeTitle|Login|Password|InternalID|PrimaryOfficeInternalID|StreetAddress1|StreetAddress2|City|ZipCode|StateCode|IsListedInAgentFinder|Active|DirectOfficePhone|Email|SecondaryOfficeInternalIDs|TemplateName

The Employee Photo BOI file is just like the Agent Photo File. Only contains employees' images that are named by the employee's internal id. This way, the photo will save to the appropriate employee when processed.
