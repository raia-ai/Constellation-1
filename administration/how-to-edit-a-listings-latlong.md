# How To Edit A Listing's Lat/Long

Sometimes a listing's location may get mapped in the incorrect spot. This can be a combination of bad data from the MLS or geocoding returning the wrong latitude and longitude. To combat this, you can edit a listing's lat/long values via Listing Editor (LE) in Admin. Furthermore, you can make it so that the listing's lat/long will not get updated again.

**Steps:** 

Log into admin  
On the left nav - Property Tools > Property Editor   
Enter MLS # and select the listing type

The listing comes back as a result, click on the 'LE' to open the listing editor.

At the top of the editor, select the Location tab -

Now you can edit the lat/long fields. To prevent the lat/long data from updating again, you can check on the "Don't Allow Updates to Geocode" checkbox.
