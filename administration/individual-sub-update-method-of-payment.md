# Individual Sub Update Method of Payment

**Helping an Individual Sub Update Their Method of Payment**&#x20;

Step 1:  Once they are logged into the account, have them click on their name in the upper right corner of Paradym and select Settings. &#x20;

Step 2:  When the agent is on the Settings page, have the agent look to the left side of the page under Account and click Billing Information. &#x20;

Step 3: When they are on the Billing Information page, advise them to update all the information in the Credit Card Information field before hitting save.  If they are only wanting to update the credit card expiration date, they will still need to enter the full credit card number in the Card Number field.  They should also verify that the Billing Details are correct or update them if needed.  See Example of this page below:&#x20;

Step 4: Hit Save.  The information should be updated.  &#x20;

If the system will not allow the agent to update the account and it is an individual sub account, it will need to be escalated to Joanne Zehr.  Customer Success Coaches should **NOT** update the billing information for an agent.  &#x20;

**Helpful Information:**  If they wish to see their billing history, they can click View next to History in the Subscription Information box on this page.  This will show them their history from the beginning of their account to the current date. The Subscription Information will also show them their Monthly Fee (less any taxes) and their payment date. &#x20;
