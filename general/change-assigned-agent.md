# Change Assigned Agent | Constellation1 Customer Hub

**Change Assigned Agent**

As a user, I want to be able to change the agent associated with a client relocation record so that I can accurately track and manage my data. In the client section, I open “Filters” and type in the last name of the agent whom I need to change. Press the “Search” button to find those records:

Once the records are displayed, I select those that I intend to change and hit “Agent Update” button:
