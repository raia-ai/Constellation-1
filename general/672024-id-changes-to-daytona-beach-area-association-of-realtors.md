# 6/7/2024 - ID Changes to Daytona Beach Area Association of REALTORS

We would like to inform you that on Friday June 7th, 2024, a change will occur in the Daytona Beach Area Association of REALTORS data feed. This change stems from an ongoing vendor system conversion and will specifically impact Office IDs.

An “o” has been added to the front of the majority of IDs (“10785” becomes “o10785”). If the “o” has not been added, the ID will remain the same through this vendor system feed conversion.
