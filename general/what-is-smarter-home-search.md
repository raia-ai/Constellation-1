# What Is Smarter Home Search

Smarter Home Search enables you to search for a property by mortgage payment. When you enter a mortgage amount, the site will return search results within 10 percent of that amount (that means no more than 10 percent over or under the amount) based on the rates shown in the Smarter Home Search box.

Please note this payment is **principal and interest only** and does not include insurance, taxes, HOA fees or other fees.

In a future update to the site, we plan to update this functionality going forward to enable visitors to modify rates, loan terms and down payment amounts, further customizing their results.
