**How to attach a 3D Model to a Visual Tour** 

**This article is guide to guide agents using the platform where and how to attach a link to a 3D model of a property (i.e., Matterport, Skyview, etc.) to the visual tours that are distributed on social media.** 

**This article assumes that you have logged into the Paradym platform and have access to My Tours and the individual tour you wish to attach the asset to, thus starting this guide at that stage.** 

**Overview:**  

**Step 1:** Click on the Additional Content link within the Options section. 

**Step 2:** Click on the green “+” sign and select the “3D Model” option. 

**Step 3:** Input the required information and choose additional options if needed. 

**Step 1:** From the top of the Tour Editing page on the particular tour you want to attach the 3D model to, scroll down, following the links on the left, until you come to the bold, black word “Options.”  The last link in that section is “Additional Content” which you need to click on to access the next screen.

**Step 2:** This screen features rows of grey and white bars, each labeled section stating, “No entries.” If you are presenting your visual tour in the Property Site format, click on any one of the grey “_I_” icons and take note of what each section on the Property Site page is called.

Otherwise, ignore that for now and click on the green plus sign in the upper right of the screen, right beside the grey “Cancel” button.  Once clicked, a drop-down of four options appear, these being the types of things you can attach as additional assets to this tour.  The first option is “3D Model” which should be clicked.

**Step 3:** This screen requires two entries: a name for how you want the link to the 3D Model to appear, and the complete webpage address (URL) of the model. 

Below those entry fields are a few options, that matter only under certain conditions.   

If you are displaying your visual tours in the Property Site format as mentioned above, you have the option of choosing where on the tour page viewers can see the 3D Model. With More Info being the default. 

If you are using the Fusion visual tour format, you can check the box to have the 3D Model present itself before any other tour media, putting the 3D Model asset front and center. 

If this visual tour is going to linked to the original listing, be sure to check the box to hide this 3D Model for viewing in unbranded IDX environments. This is especially important as to not violate any branding restrictions on your MLS.

Once all inputs and choices are made, be sure to click the green “Save” button in the upper right of the screen, which will take you back to the previous page, where you will now see your link name.
