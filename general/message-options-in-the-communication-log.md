# Message options in the Communication Log

All incoming e-mails with attachments include a link to the complete details of the message, whether it was truncated or not.  Clicking on ‘[more](http://www.lpsreg.com/)’ displays the message details and the e-mail header information.  (The message details will be displayed in plain text only; links and images will be discarded.)  There is an option to save the e-mail message as a separate document.
