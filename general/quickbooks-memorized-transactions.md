# QuickBooks® Memorized Transactions | Constellation1 Customer Hub

A recurring transaction that has been set-up in QuickBooks® is called a memorized transaction. Set-up recurring transactions to record at regular intervals over a period of time.  Choose to record automatically or have QuickBooks® remind you or just add the transaction to a list and its ready for entry at any time.  Memorized transactions reduce mistakes, keep better tabs of cash in bank and increase accuracy: A reminder each month will appear (if configured) that will allocate the same invoice when authorized, to save from re-entering identical invoices each month. 

To enter a Memorized Transaction, follow the following steps:

*   Navigate to Lists > **Memorized Transaction List**
*   Select the **Memorized Transaction** button and create **New Group**; complete the details as required
*   Once the New Group is created, you can create the invoice, transaction, check, deposit or journal entry
*   Once the invoice is created you will click **Edit** > **Memorize Invoice**
*   On new window select **With Transactions In Group** then select the **Group Name** created above
*   Do not save the invoice at this time, simply close the window
*   To process these invoices, simply highlight the transactions (or wait for reminder if selected when New Group was set up) and select **Enter Transaction** button which will load a window showing next posting date of the Group. If date is correct, select **OK**
*   Once the memorized invoices have been created, you can add any additional charges as required

Please note that any change(s) made to an existing memorized transaction will require re-memorizing the transaction
