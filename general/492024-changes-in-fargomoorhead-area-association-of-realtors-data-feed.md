We are pleased to inform you that the FargoMoorhead Area Association of REALTORS data feed will be live tomorrow on April 9th, 2024 through a vendor system conversion. As a direct result of this feed conversion, you will be noticing several changes in the existing feed:

*   Increase in listing counts due to a considerable amount of shared data from the Northstar MLS data that is now available through this feed
*   Values in the following fields will also be changing:

*   OfficeMlsIds
*   ListingsIds
*   MemberMlsIds

To facilitate a seamless transition for your operations, we have attached detailed information outlining the upcoming changes we were able to identify.
