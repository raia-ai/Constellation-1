# 1/21/2024 - Upcoming System Conversion for HighlandsCashiers Board of REALTORS Data Feed

On **Tuesday January 21st, 2024**, a vendor system conversion from **Navica to Trestle** will be implemented for this data feed. To ensure a smooth transition, we’ve made the updated data available in advance.

**Key values in all resources will be changing (ListingKey, MemberKey, OfficeKey, etc.)** as a result of this conversion. Additionally, **Member IDs will also be changing**. To assist with the transition, we’ve attached a translation document mapping the former IDs to the new ones.
