# 11/8/2023 - Changes to Richmond Association of REALTORS

We have important updates regarding the Richmond Association of REALTORS data feed. We're transitioning from using abbreviations and UserCodes for Member/Agent and OfficeMlsId to vendor-specific internal IDs starting 11/8/2023. You can find the new and old IDs in the Member and Office resources. What is currently in the altMemberMlsId field in the Member Resource will swap places across all resources with what is currently in the MemberMlsId field, and likewise the same goes with the OfficeMlsId and the altOfficeMlsId.
