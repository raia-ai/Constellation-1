# BOI - Missing Office/Agent And Or Duplicate

If you notice that an office or an Agent is missing, it is possible that it most likely was processed with an office/agent code that is being used by another one of your offices/agents. Check your roster that was processed in the BOI Log tool, and check to see if its office code matches another one of your offices.
