# Finding Archived Sessions in eSign

eSign will automatically archive a session 30 days after its been marked as Completed. Archived sessions by default, do not show on the Sessions page. But you can view them using Advanced Filters.

To view your Archived sessions, once you have logged in to your eSign account, click on the Filter icon (The funnel icon on the top right corner of the screen) and set the Status to Archived. Once that's done, set the Date range to how far back you want to search, and click on Search.

The resulting screen will show you all of your archived sessions that fall within that Date range.
