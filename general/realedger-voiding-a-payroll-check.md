# REALedger - Voiding a Payroll Check

The purpose of this article is to provide steps for voiding a payroll check. &#x20;

To void a payroll check, navigate to **Payroll>>Processing>>Edit Payroll Transactions**.  In the **Transactions to View** section, click the **Paid** button.&#x20;

Find the transaction you wish to void, and click the **Void** button.  At that time a reversing record is created, in the **Paid** view, to offset the original.&#x20;

Then switch back to the **Unpaid** view and click **Add** to create a new payroll record.  Then step through the payment process.&#x20;

Another option would be to handwrite a replacement check, for the net amount of the original check, then edit the check number on the original payment record, from the **Paid** view.  Note:  Using this method will not leave a paper trail.  If a paper trail is needed, do not use this method; void the check instead. &#x20;
