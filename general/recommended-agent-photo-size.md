# Recommended Agent Photo Size | Constellation1 Customer Hub

If an agent is wanting to update their photo, follow these requirements for best results:

*   Minimum size should be 400px wide by 520px high
*   The image's file size should be less than 2MB (2000KB)

If the photo being used is too small, do not resize it to be larger. Instead use a new photo that is larger or take a larger picture.
