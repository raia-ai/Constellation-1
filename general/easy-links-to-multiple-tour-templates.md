*   If you do not see the three numbers as shown above and instead, your URL gives you a word “true” at the end (see image below) after you have selected and inserted your link, this means that you are using an older viewer before Fusion that requires Flash player. You will want to change this older viewer to either the Fusion Viewer or Single Property Site viewer. Also known as “Skin” (see image in step 3).
