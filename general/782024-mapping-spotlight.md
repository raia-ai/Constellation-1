## Important Mapping Updates to Listings API

We have validated the mapping for three existing RESO compliant fields for approximately 350 MLSs. Specifically, these fields are:

Note that not all MLSs have data available in these fields. Should data be made available from the MLS, it will be automatically populated and delivered.&#x20;

We will also be reviewing other recently voted on RESO fields and will be adding these additional fields in the near future:

We're communicating with MLSs and major vendors to understand their plans and timelines and continuing to monitor changes from various systems including:&#x20;

* CRMLS
* BrightMLS
* MLSPIN
* StellarMLS
* HawaiiMLS
* Several other smaller MLSs

This is a dynamic situation which we expect will evolve with continued changes over the coming weeks. We will continue to communicate regularly as we learn more and implement data changes.
