# 10/11/2024 - Important Notice: Florida Gulf Coast MLS System Conversion

We are writing to inform you about an upcoming change that will affect your experience with the Florida Gulf Coast Multiple Listing Service (FGCMLS).

On October 11th, 2024, a vendor system conversion will occur, requiring a transition to the new OSN: **FGCMLS**. Please note that after this date, the current feed using OSN **FortMyers** will no longer receive updates and will become inactive.

To ensure a smooth transition, we encourage you to switch to the new OSN, **FGCMLS**, by October 10th, 2024. The new OSN is currently available for testing, providing you with an opportunity to familiarize yourself with the changes before the deadline.

Additionally, with this new OSN, you will notice an increase in listings, as it will now include shared data from the Bonita Springs-Estero MLS and Naples Area Board of REALTORS. You can use the ListAOR field to differentiate between these listings.

Thank you for your attention to this update. If you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out.
