# AutoPilots, AutoUpdates, AutoAssign important update

A big change is about to be launched in ACTIVITIES under AutoPilots, AutoUpdates, AutoAssign in Relo 2.0.

Here is what to expect.

We have added Date Ranges for easier bulk processing.  
We have created system defaults for the last 7 days in each section,  
We have added other quick date filter options for you.

This update will help you become more efficient in managing all of the emails in the AutoPilots, and all of the non responsive email in the pending updates (AutoUpdates), pending approvals (AutoAssign) sections.
