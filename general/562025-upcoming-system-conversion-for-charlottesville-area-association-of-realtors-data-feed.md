# 5/6/2025 - Upcoming System Conversion for Charlottesville Area Association of REALTORS Data Feed

We’d like to share an important update regarding the upcoming feed conversion. Please find attached an **updated Agent/Office ID Translation Document**, which reflects the latest corrections.

The conversion will still be completed on **Tuesday May 6th, 2025**.

You can begin accessing the updated data by including the **$reconvert=true** flag in your API queries. Please note that there is no change to the OriginatingSystemName (OSN) you are currently using.

With this conversion, **k**ey values in all resources will also be changing (ListingKey, MemberKey, OfficeKey, etc.)
