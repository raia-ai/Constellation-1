# Constellation1 eSign April 2021 Release Notes

Production Release: April 27, 2021

## RELEASE SUMMARY

#### **Constellation1 eSign**

**Zoom in/out on forms:** Added ability to zoom in and out on forms.&#x20;

**API:** Updated support to pause, edit or update a signing session.&#x20;

Zoom In/Out on Forms

We have added the ability to zoom in and out on forms in step 2 of the eSign creation workflow and in a signing session.

Some forms may have smaller text in some areas. This could cause challenges when placing markups and tags. Zooming in on a document will allow you to be more precise when placing tags and markups. &#x20;

With this enhancement you can:

* Zoom-in on a document up to 200%.&#x20;
* Drag and drop markups and tags.
  * Tags will move ahead of the cursor.&#x20;

The option to zoom in on a form will also be available to the signer in the signing session.&#x20;
