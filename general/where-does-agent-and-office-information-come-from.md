# Where Does Agent And Office Information Come From

Agent information is sent to RED from L&F in a file called **Back Office Import (BOI).**

This BOI file will contain information pertaining to an agent, to a list a few items:

*   Agent's Name
*   Office Information
*   Phone Numbers
*   URLs
*   Agent's Photo
*   and much more

If you have a request from an agent to update some piece of their information, then you will need to have this BOI file updated by L&F.

For example, an agent is wanting to update their photo. L&F would make the change to the BOI file first, then send the BOI file as normal to RED. That's it, from there RED's system will update the agent's information to the new data that was entered and the changes will reflect on the website and mobile app

These are the current type of BOI files that RED gets from L&F each day -

*   Agent boi
*   Agent Photo boi
*   Office boi
*   Office Photo boi
*   Service Tiles boi **(agent version only, office version in future)**
*   Employee boi
*   Team boi

Also, there are a few places on the website that get populated for an agent through L&F's API known as DataPassport. But overall the overwhelming majority of information you see comes from the BOI.
