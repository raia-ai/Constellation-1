# 5/30/2025 - Upcoming System Conversion for Kings County Board of REALTORS Data Feed

On **Friday May 30, 2025**, a vendor system conversion will be implemented for this data feed. To ensure a smooth transition, we’ve made the updated data available in advance. You can access this data by adding the **$reconvert=true** flag in your queries. Please note that there is no change to the OSN that you are currently using.

**Key values in all resources will be changing (ListingKey, MemberKey, OfficeKey, etc.)** as a result of this conversion. Agent and Office IDs have also changed and we have attached detailed information outlining the changes.
