Fusion vs Property Site Skins 

There is a common misconception related to the Property Tour. 

In this article, both skins will be covered.

First, let's show you where you can even find the option for Skin. 

**Step 1)** Click on your name in the upper right and choose **My Tours**.

**Step 2)** Click on the tour in question and look at the left hand column for **Skin**.

**Step 3)** Below is what the following page will display. You will see our two available skins. Fusion and Property Site.

**Step 4)** So which one should you choose? First, let's review how they differ. By hitting Preview below either of them will open a new window to play the tour.

Below is the Fusion preview. You will notice a play button to immediately begin previewing the tour. Simple, easy, and straight to the point.

The Property Site is much different, however. When you begin previewing the Property Site skin, it looks like it automatically begins playing. 

This is actually not the case, however. What it does is goes through 3 to 4 random photos, typically near the beginning of the tour along with property information. 

You will notice at the bottom of it there is an arrow pointing down inside of a circle, directing you to scroll down. You will see both screens below.

You will see there are three options in the second photo.   **Gallery**, **Video**, and **Visual Tour**. 

It is there where you will hit the Visual Tour option to play the actual tour. 

So what is the purpose of the Property Site, then?  
It showcases the listing, appears as its own website or landing page along with spreading out the information. 

**What is the difference between Video and Visual** **Tour?  
**Video is the tour that has been uploaded to YouTube while the Visual Tour plays in our viewer or skin. 

**Other common questions to consider.**

**Q: My tour is playing but there is no voice or music.  
A:** That is the preview. You must scroll down and hit Visual Tour to preview the tour. 

**Q: My tour is only playing through a few photos. There are way more photos on here than this.   
A:** That is because you have to scroll down past the preview and click Visual Tour to play it.

**Q: Which is better? Fusion or Property Site?  
A:** That is a choice you must choose based on how you would like to present your tour. They both have their own unique ways of displaying the property.
