The purpose of this article is to provide the steps to customize the Transactions landing page. 

**Please note**: The Transactions landing page can be filtered via Advanced Filters as shown in the screen shot below. When no filters are engaged, the Advanced Filters icon will display in black and when filters are engaged, the Advanced Filters icon will display in blue.

Not only do users have the ability to search a transaction number, MLS number or part of the address but users can filter any transactions in the application by Status.

The default status is Pending, however users can simply select All, Cancelled or Closed from the drop down. 

In addition to status users can further filter by way of the second drop down box which will allow users to filter by:

*   All
*   Month to Date
*   Quarter to Date
*   Year to Date
*   Last 12 Months

By clicking on the column headings of Address, Agent and Close Date users can also sort the transactions in alphabetical or chronological order for ease of navigation. Once selected, the sort will remain in place the next time the same user logs in. 

Finally, users can select which columns to display on the Transactions landing page.

To configure this, select the "book" icon on the left as noted in the screen shot below;

The list of columns will be displayed where users can select a **maximum of 6.** 

Once selected, the Transaction landing page will display the columns users selected.
