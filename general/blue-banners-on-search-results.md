Since **only one** message can display on a single property, the priority order is as follows (in the case where a property meets requirements for more than one badge):

1\. MLS Status, ex: SOLD, PENDING, CONTINGENT 

*   If status is closed, then it will show as 'SOLD xx/xx/xx' ie: SOLD 5/22/17

2\. Commercial, ex: $XX/SQFT

3\. Open House Today

4\. Open House Soon, for when an open house is 4 days or less away

5\. Price Change 

6\. Open House Date, for when next open house is 5 days or more away

7\. New Listing
