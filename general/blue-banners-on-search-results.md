# Blue Banners On Search Results

We’ve identified key items that are of interest to shoppers, such as open houses and price changes, and the site identifies those items and highlights them on the search results to increase engagement on our site.

Since **only one** message can display on a single property, the priority order is as follows (in the case where a property meets requirements for more than one badge):

1\. MLS Status, ex: SOLD, PENDING, CONTINGENT&#x20;

* If status is closed, then it will show as 'SOLD xx/xx/xx' ie: SOLD 5/22/17

2\. Commercial, ex: $XX/SQFT

3\. Open House Today

4\. Open House Soon, for when an open house is 4 days or less away

5\. Price Change&#x20;

6\. Open House Date, for when next open house is 5 days or more away

7\. New Listing
