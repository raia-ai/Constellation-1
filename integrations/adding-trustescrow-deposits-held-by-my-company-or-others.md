**Held By Any Contact Other Than "My Company"**

Navigate to the Deposits card of the transaction and in the Held By field start typing the contacts name.  If there are multiple contacts with the same name, we will display the address and phone number if entered so user will know which contact to select.

If the contact is not found, select \+ Add New and minimally complete the fields designated by an asterisk, however we encourage complete data entry when possible.
