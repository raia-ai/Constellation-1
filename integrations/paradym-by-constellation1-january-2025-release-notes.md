Bug Fixes&#x20;

1\. We fixed an issue with posts to LinkedIn failing.

Previously, when posting to LinkedIn, the posts would fail and not be posted.&#x20;

Now, this issue has been resolved. Without warning, LinkedIn updated their API, preventing Paradym to connect with LinkedIn.&#x20;

2\. We fixed an issue with photo posts not retaining the correct order and sorting photos in a random order.

Previously, when a photo post with multiple photos was posted to social media, the photos were being posted in a random order and not retaining the pre-selected sort order.&#x20;

Now, this issue has been resolved. \
&#x20;

3\. We fixed an issue with the Click To Chat window closing before a customer can enter a message on shared listing posts.&#x20;

Previously, when a listing was shared and posted to social medial with the Click to Chat feature enabled, customers could initiate a chat session however the window would close before they could enter a message and establish contact with the agent.&#x20;

Now, this issue has been resolved.&#x20;

4\. We fixed an issue with notifications not being sent to the agent when YouTube video post is scheduled.

Previously, if a broker posted an agent's video to YouTube without the agent establishing a connection to their own channel, and the broker opted to notify the agent, the agent did not receive the notification.

Now, this issue has been resolved. Agents don’t need a connection to YouTube to be notified of videos being posted by their broker.&#x20;

5\. We fixed an issue with the Paradym notification system.

Previously, the Paradym notification system could be utilized by our developers to communicate system updates, changes and other important information to our users. This system was not presenting notifications to uses.&#x20;

Now, this issue has been resolved and users will receive system notifications as expected.&#x20;

Technology Updates

1\. We’ve upgraded the system from .Net Framework 4.8 to .net Framework 8.0.

2\. we’ve removed the Google Maps API key, improving system security.
