# Processing a Transaction's Closing Where An Agent is Paid as an Employee with Integration to QuickBo

On occasion, Real Estate Brokerages have the requirement to pay Agents, Managers, Owners, etc. as an Employee.  These Employees will be subject to payroll deductions such as Federal Taxes, Pension Contributions, etc. just like your staff members.  Agents will be paid via Payroll in QuickBooks®.

Some notes to consider when paying an Agent as an Employee:

* Monies will be moved out of affected bank accounts (operating/general and/or commission trust) via Journal Entry depending on your configuration
* Cheque/check for the Agent as an Employee will be processed manually via Payroll
* Reversing a transaction will NOT reverse a "Pay Cheque/Check" only the "Cheque/Check" previously sent, this will need to be done manually
* If Agent is paid from a different bank account than your staff, it is your responsibility to ensure that your monthly payroll liabilities are paid accordingly
* This logic does not apply to Agents paid via Bonus Override&#x20;

To proceed, follow the steps noted below;

1\. On the left navigation bar select **System Settings / General Ledger**, ensure that you have mapped the **Pay Employee from Bank** and the **Payroll Expense** accounts accordingly.

3\. The Agent will integrate to the Employee list in QuickBooks® in preparation for you to manually run payroll.  In QuickBooks®, the Agents name will display as **Employee {Agent}, Alison** where {Agent} is ignored and will not display or print on the actual Pay Cheque/Check.

4\. In QuickBooks®, users will complete the rest of the information required to run payroll for this Employee such as taxes, retirement contributions, vacation pay, direct deposit options, etc.  We suggest creating a new payroll schedule of "Commissions" to keep Agents separate from your staff.&#x20;

5\. You are now ready to Process the Transactions Closing as usual. &#x20;

6\. Once cheques/checks are integrated to QuickBooks®, users will use the amount displayed on the "Cheque/Check" to manually run Payroll within QuickBooks®. Remove check from "Print Later/To Print".   The only purpose of this cheque/check is to transfer monies from a commission trust bank account to the operating/general bank account if configured, users will still need to physically transfer the money from one bank account to the other.&#x20;
