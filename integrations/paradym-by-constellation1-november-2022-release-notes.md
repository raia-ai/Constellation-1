## RELEASE DETAILS 

My Tours – Added Link to Listing   
We have improved usability and marketing opportunities with the addition of adding a hyperlink to a property tour that links to the property detail page.   
When a property tour is created, we will automatically add a link to the tour that will take the user to the listing detail page on the agent website. If we don’t have an agent website for the user, we will link to the property details on the MLS using the URL provided by the MLS. 

Login Page   
On the login page, there is a check box that when selected will keep the user logged in to their account on that computer. The Login status will now persist for 180 days from the initial successful login when the Keep Me Logged In is selected.   
 

Bug Fixes 

•    We fixed a compliance issue with the display of listings on FindAPlace4Me.com.   
Previously, the zip code for the subject property was not displayed on the listing detail page.   
Now, we have corrected this issue and now include the zip code on the property detail page. 

  
•    We fixed an issue with tour videos not rendering.   
Previously, when a tour video was created, the last step of rendering the video would not finish. The process didn’t time out nor did the video complete this process.    
Now, this issue has been corrected. Rendering the video will complete allowing the user to post the video. 

•    We fixed an issue with text messages sent by the broker not being received by the recipient.   
Previously, when a broker would send an SMS/Text message, the messages were not being received by the recipient, due to configuration changes made by Twillio.   
Now, When a broker sends an SMS/Text message, the message will be delivered. 

•    We fixed an issue with a new user receiving the incorrect email message when a broker created a new user account via the Add Agent in Account Management.   
Previously, when a new user account was created by a broker, the new user would receive an email with an image of the login screen and no information to login to their account. The user should have received the New Account Registration email.   
Now, when a broker creates a new user account, the new user will receive the New Account Registration email with the information needed to log into their account. 

  
•    We fixed an issue with a broker receiving an error message when creating a new account.   
Previously, when a broker created a new user account, in some cases the broker may receive a Microsoft error message.   
Now, this issue has been corrected. When a broker creates a new user account, the account will be created as expected. 

  
•    We fixed an issue with Tours not being created for some new user accounts.   
Previously, for some new users of Paradym, when a new listing is added the property Tour was not being created.   
Now, when new listings are added, a property Tour will automatically be created. 

  
•    We fixed an issue with the draft version of a listing tour being published.   
Previously, when a listing tour is in draft status, then the listing is updated with a price change, the listing would automatically be published.   
Now, when a tour is in draft status, and the listing is updated, the tour will remain as a draft and not automatically be published.   
Note: Tours can be published automatically if selected in Settings > Publishing. 

•     We fixed an issue with listing tours not posting to FMLS.   
Previously, when a tour is created for agents associated with FMLS, their tours were not being posted to FMLS due to a change in the FMLS login system.   
Now, this issue has been corrected. Tours will be posted to FMLS. 

  
•    We fixed an issue with changing an agent’s office association.   
Previously, when a broker changed an agent’s office, the system didn’t save the change.   
Now, when a broker changes an agent’s office, the change will be saved as expected. 

  
•    We fixed an issue with tour videos not posting to the broker YouTube channel.   
Previously, when an agent published a property tour the tour was not being published on the broker’s YouTube channel.   
Now, this issue has been corrected. Tours published by the agent and has selected to have the tour also post to the broker YouTube channel, will be posted to the broker’s YouTube channel.
