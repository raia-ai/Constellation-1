# eSign - Sessions In Progress

Signer invitations are emailed out to signers and those signers enter the eSign application to electronically sign the documents.  As each signer signs, entries are made in the session’s activity log and email notifications are generated for remaining signers or the session is closed if none remain. Integrations typically receive notifications to their listener web service in order to catalog session information and collect signed documents.  The listener web services usually only require a session ID and status, but for client applications that require a tighter integration such as the ability to copy sessions from their own UI the service may want more information.  Speak with your eSign representative to get the best idea on how to approach tighter integrations.
