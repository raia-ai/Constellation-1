# RDesk CRM Contact Detail Page - User Guide

## OVERVIEW:

Real Estate Digital’s (RED) new Contact Details Page for CRM Desktop was designed with ease-of-use and complete intuitiveness in mind by leveraging today’s best User Experience design practices. The new page will allow Agents and Admins to perform the everyday basic - yet essential - functions needed when fostering a lead into a bona fide opportunity. From collecting valuable profile information on your buying or selling customer, to adding pertinent notes, to viewing recent online browsing activity on your customer, or to adding your customer to a marketing plan – the new RED Contact Details page has you covered.

**Some Key Features:**

* **To Dos** – create, manage, and complete your Tasks To Dos
* **Contact Management** – new and improved Contact add and edit UX that allows the user to intuitively add additional contacts associated to the primary contact (i.e. the significant other, spouse, co-investor)
* **Website Info Center** – consolidates all your important rW Website notification information
* **Customer Profile** – collect all your customer’s vital profile and property details information associated with their buying and selling preferences
* **Recent Activity Center** – a 30-day lookback at any saved properties, saved searches, action plan activities and To Do’s scheduled or completed by either you or your customer
* **Groups and Action Plans** – the ability to add contact to a Group (e.g. Investor Group) or to add a contact to an Action Plan are still present – with a new, easier, user interface!
* **Agent Assignment** – Fast and easy assignment of contacts with auto-suggest/auto-complete
* **Registration** – a simple, 2-click registration process for your contacts!

You may notice that some tabs – namely, the “Personal Info, “Summary,” and “Search” tabs are no longer available. While we have removed those tabs, we’ve made sure to ensure that the same functions you’re used to are still available on the New Contact Details Page User Interface and within CRM.

## TEXT AVATAR & ESSENTIAL CONTACT INFORMATION SECTION

1. In the upper left-hand header section of the Contact Details Page resides the “Text Avatar,” which will display the first initial and last initial of the primary Contact’s first and last name, respectively.
2. Directly underneath the contact’s name is the Contact’s primary phone number on file, which the user can tap on and select while accessing this page on a mobile device to call the contact
3. Underneath the primary phone number is the primary email address for the Contact, which can also be clicked while on desktop to open your default email client (e.g. Microsoft Outlook) or tapped on when on a mobile device to email the contact using your mobile device’s default email client (e.g. Gmail, Yahoo! Mail)

## BUYING, SELLING, PROSPECT IDENTIFIERS

Directly to the right of the Contact’s name is the Buying, Selling, Prospect Identifier section. Based on considerable feedback from agents, the intent and purpose is to easily display visual identifiers to Agents on whether the customer contact is a buying prospect, selling prospect, or simply a prospect at a very quick glance.

Methods on how a Contact is added and identified as either a Buying, Selling or Prospect:

1. Whenever a customer contact is added to the “group” of “buyer” he/she will displayed to this top identifier section
2. Example: Sam Agent manually adds Joe Buyer to the “Buyer” group via the “Groups” module on this Contact Details page, which will then dynamically display the “Buying” icon

## CONTACT STATUS – DROP DOWN SELECTOR

* The Contact Status drop-down selection displays the Contact’s “status,” which is a static list supported in the previous Contact Details version

## LEAD, CONTACT AND CLIENT BUTTON LABEL

There is a new styled button which will display the Contact Type for your customer

* The available Contact Types remain the same – Lead, Contact or Client

## REGISTERING A CONTACT

Nested in between the Contact Type button and Pre-Qualification button, on the upper-right hand, top section of the Details page is where you will be able to register your customer contacts

![](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/api/attachments/image/2472652/8b92afe3-5beb-4bde-afc1-44a2e009abe4.png)

1. Hovering the “Unregistered” button will display quick instructions on how to register your contact should you desire ![](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/api/attachments/image/2472652/73290abd-05b8-43b8-b982-b90b9bae389e.png)
2. Selecting the “Unregistered” button hyperlink will pop a message overlay for you to confirm whether you would like to Register the contact
   1. NOTE: the Unregistered button can appear for the contact Types of “Lead” or “Contact”![](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/api/attachments/image/2472652/dcda65d8-27e9-45c4-8762-ad50fc663aa0.png)
3. Selecting “Yes, Register” will ping our registration service, which will register your customer contact using your customer’s “primary” email address as their username - AND - a random, auto-generated password will be sent to your customer’s primary email address
   1. When you register your customer your customer will turn into a Registered Client, and the respective buttons in the top-right bar will indicate that (as seen in below)
      1. &#x20;    You are now able to save properties and searches for your customer as a result!![](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/api/attachments/image/2472652/111d1369-4439-4974-8a1c-80759a8c1637.png)

## CONVERTING A REGISTERED LEAD INTO A REGISTERED CLIENT

In some instances, you may have a Lead that is already registered assigned to you. Additionally, in some cases the Lead you are actively working may also be working with another agent from a different office. This can happen in Franchise/Broker/Office configuration instances when there can be multiple offices with multiple RED rW Office websites involved, and/or RED rW Agent websites for which a customer can submit multiple leads, which, in at times, can result in that same customer working with different agents from the same Company.

To solve for this, we implemented a simple “flag” on the Lead Button (or “Contact” button if the contact is a “Contact”) with hover over messaging, which can simply be understood as:

* If there is a Registered Lead _without_ a Flag (no flag present) = you can convert this Lead to a Client
* If there is a Registered Lead _with_ a Flag = you cannot convert this Lead to a Client and to contact your Admin in order to sort things out if you wish

o   When there is a flag present it means that your contact is also a contact with another agent within your Company as a registered Client

**An example of a Registered Lead without a “Flag” (you can convert these into a “Client”)**

![](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/api/attachments/image/2472652/859bd3d5-3fc4-45d0-b44a-465bd3ab6ae2.png)

* When you select/click the Lead button > a message overlay will appear

![](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/api/attachments/image/2472652/ec0339c0-4c65-421d-a378-d84e9fe61372.png)

* Selecting/clicking “Yes, Proceed” will convert the Lead into a Client

**When there is a Registered Lead – and there IS a Flag present – in the Lead button selecting/clicking the “Lead” button will pop a message overlay informing you to contact your Admin (i.e. this means your contact is also a contact assigned with another agent as a registered “Client”)**

Note: By contacting your Admin, he/she and the relevant parties involved will be able to address appropriately the best course of action in customer assignment.

## CONVERTING A REGISTERED CONTACT INTO A REGISTERED CLIENT

The same logic that applies to converting a registered Lead into a registered Client (see directly above for more info) applies to “Contacts,” which are by definition manually added contacts that you added yourself (i.e. you met this potential client at a dinner and added his/her contact to “manually” into your CRM address book)

* If there is a Registered Contact without a Flag (no flag present) = you can convert this Contact to a Client
* If there is a Registered Contact with a Flag = you cannot convert this Contact to a Client and to contact your Admin in order to sort things out if you wish

o   When there is a flag present it means that your contact is also a contact with another agent within your Company as a registered Client

## PRE-QUALIFICATION AND PRE-QUALIFICATION AMOUNT&#x20;

We display pre-qualification information you capture for the Customer Profile (Buying only) you input and save.

Some key points:

* The button by default will display “Not Pre-qualified” until you create a “Buying” Profile AND select “Yes” on the “Pre-Qualified” question on the Buying Profile form

o   If you select the “Yes” button on the “Pre-Qualified” question the “Not Qualified” button will dynamically convert to “Pre-qualified”

* If there are multiple Buyer Profiles that have a “Pre-qualification” and a “Pre-qual Amount,” we will display the most recent pre-qual amount in the upper right hand corner bar (as seen in below screen capture)

## CONTACT SCORE

![](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/api/attachments/image/2472652/4fdabf4c-10fa-42df-a30f-39d86b2139c0.png)

As in the previous version of our Contact Details Page, we have retained the Contact Score feature. This relative score is indicative of the online activity and behaviors of your customer, and is configured by your Admin.

Online activity such as Listing Inquiry submissions, Saved Properties and Saved Searches can impact a contact’s score. Your Admin will the best person to address as to how exactly a contact’s score is calculated.

## AGENT ASSIGNMENT

Directly above the Customer Profile module resides the Agent Assignment box, which displays who the customer contact is currently assigned to

* Note: only users with Admin credentials will be able to reassign a contact to another Agent and will be able to see the “Reassign” link (as seen below)
* The Agent Assignment box utilizes auto-suggest, auto-complete (i.e. typing in “Deb” will auto suggest “Deborah,” “Debbie,” etc)

## TO DOS – CREATING A TO DO&#x20;

The To Dos module allows you to create, edit and complete tasks and follow-ups for your customers. Created and Completed To Dos also display in the “Recent Activity” module as well, if the To Do was created within the last 30 days

To Dos were developed and designed to work in sync with RED’s new CRM Mobile App, allowing you to see all your created To Dos on either the desktop version of CRM or the CRM Mobile App will be in sync. Additionally, when you select a “Reminder” option on your To Dos, you’ll be able to receive a push notification reminder on your iOS or Android device if you have the CRM app installed

1. Creating a To Do
2. Select a the “+ To Dos” link and a To Do modal will spawn, allowing you to select from various tasks (drop-down selection), selecting a date, start and end time, inputting a note, and a reminder option
3. Selecting a “Reminder” option (e.g. selecting “5 mins before”)

## TO DOS – COMPLETING A TO DO

When you select/click a To Do which displays a check mark on the UI, the “Mark Complete” actionable button will become active, allowing you the ability to complete your To Do, which removes the To Do from view in the module

The completed To Do will record in the History tab and will also be recorded and displayed in the Recent Activity module

CONTACT DETAILS – EDITING, ADDING AND DELETING A CONTACT

Selecting the “pencil” icon is your starting point for editing, adding or deleting a contact. The user experience and functions of this section mimic that of a mobile phone experience.

![](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/api/attachments/image/2472652/89168259-de40-4ce3-91ed-89b6cf849650.png)

## PERSONAL DETAILS

The Personal Details module is placed directly below the Contact Details module and displays pertinent personal information about your customer that can be useful for rapport building and for future outreach

![](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/api/attachments/image/2472652/f78d08b6-5515-4b75-b93f-4297de13363a.png)

## WEBSITE INFO

The Website Info module allows the agent to toggle on certain rW platform website related features that pertain to the customer receiving emails and/or texts for saved properties and saved searches.

* Within the “Notifications” section of this Website Info module, the agent can toggle on/off for their customer to receive Saved Searches and Saved Properties emails/texts – and also the frequency in which they receive those emails/texts.

![](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/api/attachments/image/2472652/7a5f9d73-185b-4dd4-a2aa-a52fa6046929.png)

* The “System” Status is currently tied to your customer’s rW website activity. If your registered customer does not login to the website within a 90-day time frame, they will become “Inactive” and will not receive emails/texts for their saved properties or searches, unless they are toggled to “Active” again

Note: the system status time frame is configurable (i.e. the time frame can be longer than 90 days)

## CUSTOMER PROFILE – FOR BUYERS/SELLERS&#x20;

Capturing important buying or selling profile information for your customer is important for knowledge reference, marketing or for specific, pointed communications during the qualification phase all the way to the post-close phase. In order to address this need, we’re now providing the ability to capture this information via either “Buying” or “Selling” Customer Profiles. You can create as many buyer or seller profiles as you’d like since it’s possible that your customer may be looking to purchase or sell a property in multiple different areas (e.g. states or cities) and require multiple profiles.

**Buyer Profile** – contains buyer specific criteria, including property details criteria

* In order to start creating a “Buyer Profile,” simply click/select “+ Create Profile” and then select “Buying,” then click/select the blue “Create” button

**Seller Profile** – contains criteria specific to a potential property to be listed for sale

* In order to start creating a “Seller Profile,” simply click/select “+ Create Profile” and then select “Selling,” then click/select the blue “Create” button

## CONTACT NOTES

Input your notes for your customer. Start by simply clicking “+ Add Note”

![](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/api/attachments/image/2472652/d1bf21a5-2cf1-4426-9b53-e3e8635a2323.png)

## RECENT ACTIVITY – A 30 DAY LOOKBACK (MODULE)&#x20;

The Recent Activity module displays important customer website activity (Saved Searches, Saved Properties) as well as any Action Plan activities of To Dos activities that have occurred within the past 30-day time period &#x20;

![](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/api/attachments/image/2472652/aafde46d-1e7f-4c1d-8afd-26904f18ba9c.png)

## GROUPS

Within our Groups module, you’ll be able to add your customers to a group, edit what groups they’re in, or remove them from a group with a few intuitive clicks.

* In order to add a contact to a group, simply click/select the “+ Group” hyperlink next to the “Groups” label to start the process
* To view what groups your contact is currently in, click on the “edit” pencil and you’ll be able to view all the groups he/she is, as well as be able to edit what groups you would like them to be in
* You can remove a contact from a specific group by simply clicking on the “trash can” icon next to the applicable group

## ACTION PLANS

RED’s Action Plans module behaves very similarly to the Groups module above it. The main differences being that we display the applicable time frame for which the specific Action Plan is (or was) scheduled, and also allow a preview feature via the “preview” icon, which is positioned to the left of the “trash can” icon.

## LEAD EMAIL PARSER & THE DISPLAY OF “LEAD SOURCE EMAIL”&#x20;

New and available for Beta testing for interested clients, is RED’s new “Lead Email Parser,” which is essentially a service feature that captures 3rd party leads (e.g. leads that you’re getting from Realtor.com, Zillow, etc) and automatically pulls them into RED’s CRM, while creating a new contact record for you and providing you the ability to review the original lead email contents at any time for reference. It’s that simple.

![](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/api/attachments/image/2472652/e1a82d36-955f-4550-b095-e99f31183b18.png)

(Clicking on “Show lead source email…” will display the original lead email file for reference at any time)

* Set-up for Lead Email Parser will require minutes of work and just entails you asking your RED Account Manager for more information in order to set up this feature

Lead Email Parser is mobile-friendly which allows for Agents to preview and accept leads via their mobile device, as long as they have RED CRM Mobile app installed (iOS & Android). Coming Soon!
