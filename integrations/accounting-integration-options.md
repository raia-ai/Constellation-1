# Accounting Integration Options | Constellation1 Customer Hub

One of the great features of Commissions Online is its ability to integrate with a variety of Accounting systems, ie. QuickBooks® Online or Desktop, and Xero

Should your office NOT integrate with QuickBooks® or Xero it is possible to turn this integration feature **OFF** by navigating to System Settings/Advanced Settings and selecting **No Accounting Integration** to the right of Accounting System.

This will disengage any type of integration with an accounting package, QuickBooks® or otherwise.

**Items to note when No Accounting Integration is selected**

Deposits/Disbursements

When saving a Deposit or Disbursement on a Transaction, note that "**Sync to Accounting System**" will be toggled **OFF** by default and only the option to **Save** will be available
