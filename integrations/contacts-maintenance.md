To avoid duplicate contacts, the application is designed to initiate a search prior to adding a new contact. To start, simply start typing the contact's name: 

*   If the contact exists, select the appropriate name from the search results and the rest of the information will auto populate for you.
*   If the contact does not exist, select \+ Add New and complete the information as needed, including the mandatory fields noted with an asterisk \*.
*   You must define what type of contact you are entering via “Please Select” beside the contact name
    *   If Individual, the system considers first and last name as mandatory fields to enter and will require a SSN/SIN.
    *   If Company, the system considers the company name as a mandatory field to enter and will require a EIN/Business Number.
*   Eligible for 1099/T4A as a Vendor; when toggled ON will ensure this contact is integrated to the Vendor list in QuickBooks® with the "Vendor eligible for 1099" check initiated saving you invaluable time when its time to process 1099's or T4A's. 

Select **Save** once you have finished adding the contact.

**Deleting/Inactivating a Contact**

Occasionally you may find a duplicate contact within your database and wish to delete or inactivate them. Deleting a contact will completely removed the contact from your system.  Inactivating will retain the contact but change their status to Inactive so that they can be reactivated at some point in the future if desired.

To delete the contact

*   navigate to Contacts menu on the left navigation bar and search for the contact to delete.
*   Select the ellipsis to the right of the contact and select **Delete.**

To inactivate the contact 

*   navigate to Contacts menu on the left navigation bar and search for the contact to delete.
*   Select the ellipsis to the right of the contact and select **Edit.**
*   toggle OFF the Active status and select **Save.**

**Note**:  If the contact is attached to a transaction the application will not allow you to delete or inactivate it. 

Please note:  If there is an integration error with the contact's name once synched to QuickBooks®, you can select the Reset Accounting ID button to break the integration and re-establish a new integration connection with this contact to see if that resolves the error. Please be mindful of selecting Reset Accounting ID as it has caused duplicate QuickBooks® Vendors in the past.
