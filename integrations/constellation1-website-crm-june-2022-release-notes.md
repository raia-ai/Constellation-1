Recommended and Similar Properties Emails

We recently announced the release of phase 1 of Recommended Properties, an automated email service that sends listing suggestions to your clients based on their past searches. &#x20;

In this release, we’re pleased to announce the release of phase 2, which includes 3 new Similar Properties emails:\
•    Similar Properties Just Listed \
•    Similar Properties with a Price Change\
•    Similar Properties Recently Sold

Emails will include at least 1 listing and a maximum of 10 listings, sorted to present your brokerage’s listings first, then by most recent update in the previous 7 days.&#x20;

Recommended Properties emails use the consumer’s most recent saved property and the following criteria:\
•    Similar property types\
•    Pre-determined radius from the saved property\
•    Price range – 10% higher or lower than the saved price\
•    Plus or minus 1 bedroom\
•    Plus or minus 1 bathroom\
•    Change in the past 7 days

Emails are sent once a week on the following schedule:\
•    Monday – Recommended Properties\
•    Tuesday – Similar Properties Just Listed\
•    Thursday – Similar Properties with a Price Change\
•    Friday – Similar Properties Recently Sold

Emails will feature the same branding and color scheme as those defined in the CRM.&#x20;

Action Plan Manager Email Open Rate

In our last release, we announced we’d added real-time open rates to the Action Plan Manager report. This month, we’ve expanded this feature to include email open rates in the Action Plan Manager dashboard widget.&#x20;

The open rate shows the top 5 emails opened in the past 6 months. The results will sort by Open Count and then Open Rate Percentage

Clicking View More will open the full Acton Plan Manager report. This feature is available for agent accounts only.

Action Plan Manager Next Send Date

We’ve improved the Action Plan Manager widget on the CRM Dashboard to include the next send date for an Action Plan email activity. This gives the agent a quick reference for when the next email will be sent.&#x20;

On the Action Plan Manager widget under the Plans tab, we added a new column for the Next Send Date.&#x20;

For example, the Welcome Buyers Action Plan might have a send date of July 10 for one lead and a send date of July 16 for another lead. The widget will show July 10 because that is the next date the email is scheduled to be sent.&#x20;

Clicking View More will open the Acton Plan Manager report.

This feature is available for agent accounts only.

Action Plan Manager Editor

We’ve enlarged the content editing tool for better usability when editing Action Plan activities. The larger canvas provides a simplified user interface, removing the need for the right/left scroll bar, and places the editing tools on one line at the top of the editor.

Lead Ingestion Email Improvements

The lead ingestion email is an easy way to receive leads from third-party lead sources and automatically add them to your CRM.&#x20;

We’ve improved the email workflow and now allow agents to add the email address to the CC field. Previously, the lead ingestion email address needed to be in the To field of the lead notification email sent from your third-party lead source. Now, it can be in either the To field or the CC field.&#x20;

This improvement allows agents to use their email address as the primary To address and add the lead ingestion email address as the CC address for the third-party lead source.&#x20;

Contact Import

We’ve added Home Anniversary to the contact import file. Agents can now import a contact with their home anniversary date included in their record.&#x20;

[Click here](https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/Wiki/WikiDocs/2472652/Release%20Notes/SampleLeadImportFile.csv) to view and download the updated import template.&#x20;

Customer Profile – Price Range

We’ve made setting the price range more intuitive and easier to use when creating a Buyer or Seller customer profile.&#x20;

When setting the minimum or maximum price, the user is presented with a dropdown, allowing them to select the price from a pick list. The user can type up to nine numbers to set a specific price.&#x20;

![](https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/Wiki/WikiDocs/2472652/images/KB-ReleaseNotes/Website%20CRM/06%20June%202022/2022-June-CRM-CurtProfile-PriceRange.png)

We’ve also added a validation to the price range. When selecting the price range, if the minimum price is greater than the maximum price, the user will receive an error message. When the price range is in the correct format, the user will be able to save the profile.

This functionality has also been included on the CRM Mobile App for a consistent user experience.&#x20;

Manage Leads&#x20;

We’ve improved several Filter By features on the Manage Leads page.&#x20;

We’ve added an option to filter leads by Status.&#x20;

![](https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/Wiki/WikiDocs/2472652/images/KB-ReleaseNotes/Website%20CRM/06%20June%202022/2022-June-CRM-APM-FliterStatus.png)

We’ve also added the ability to filter leads by Office.

In the Filters section, when the Assigned To option is selected, the user can select one or more offices. Selecting an office will display all agents at that office. If no agents are selected, the filter will show leads for all agents at the selected office.

The user also has the option to hold Ctrl on a PC or hold the Command key (⌘) on a Mac and click to select multiple agents and filter the leads assigned to them.

In addition, we’ve increased the size of the box that displays the Filter By options to improve usability and allow the user to see the entire label shown in the box.&#x20;

Contact Names in Browser Tabs

For improved usability in the contacts module, we’ve added the name of the contact to the browser tab. Now when the user opens different contacts in multiple tabs, the contact’s name will display in the browser tab for easier reference.

User Login Page – Forgot Password

We’ve made improvements to the Forgot Password workflow on the CRM login page. Now when a user clicks on the Forgot Password link, they will be taken to another page and prompted to enter their username. After submitting their username, the system will send an email to the address associated with their account with instructions to update their password.&#x20;

The updated password will apply to the user’s desktop and mobile CRM and website accounts.&#x20;

Single Sign-On to the Website Admin

We’ve improved the workflow when logging into the website admin from the CRM.

Previously when logged into the CRM and clicking the Website Administration link, the user was sent to a website admin landing page, where they needed to click another link to log into their website admin dashboard.

Now, when a user clicks the Website Administration link in the CRM, they will be taken directly to the website admin dashboard. \
This improved workflow is specific to agents with a CMS website.&#x20;

## CONSTELLATION1 WEBSITES

Consumer Social Media Login

We’ve improved the workflow for creating and logging in to accounts on Constellation1 Websites for consumers who use social media. The account creation and login steps have been condensed to a single click.&#x20;

When a consumer clicks on any of the social media icons, Websites will use their social media information to either create an account or log them into their existing account.&#x20;

Each company can choose which social media icons to display on the Login page. Currently, these include:\
•    Facebook \
•    Google\
•    LinkedIn\
•    Twitter\
Consumers will also soon be able to log in using their Apple ID.

Contact your Constellation1 representative to have social media logins enabled for your website. &#x20;

## BUG FIXES

#### CRM&#x20;

*   Fixed an issue with the dashboard Lead Activity Widget.  \
    Previously, when the screen resolution was not optimal, the circles were not round. ![](https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/Wiki/WikiDocs/2472652/images/KB-ReleaseNotes/Website%20CRM/06%20June%202022/2022-June-CRM-LeadActivity-Before.png)

    Now, the circles on the widget have been optimized to display round circles.\

#### Mobile CRM App

* Fixed an issue with a contact not being associated with a To-Do item in the mobile app. Previously, on the desktop CRM, when a To-Do item was created and assigned to a contact, the contact’s name would not appear with the To-Do.\
  Now, when a To-Do is created and assigned to a contact, the contact will show with the To-Do on the CRM Mobile app home screen.

#### Website

* Fixed an issue with the agent CMS website admin not saving widgets to the user’s list. Previously, when an agent would customize and save a content widget, the saved widget would not show in the user’s list of widgets. Now, when a customized widget is saved, it will show and be available in the users widget list.
