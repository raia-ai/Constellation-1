# 10/15/2024 - Integration of Palmetto MLS Listings into CHS Regional MLS Feed

We would like to inform you that listings from the Palmetto Multiple Listing Service (OSN Palmetto) are now part of the CHS Regional MLS (OSN CTAR) data feed. This change was implemented without prior notice from the MLS, and we understand the impact this may have on your processes.

As part of this update, please be aware that both Office and Member IDs for Palmetto MLS listings will be updated.

To help you navigate these changes smoothly, we have attached a detailed guide with key information on the updates and their potential effect on your operations.
