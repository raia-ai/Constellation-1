## Release Summary 

**Bug Fixes**

## Release Details  

Bug Fixes   
1\. We fixed an issue listing sync and tour creation process being disabled.  
Previously, in some cases and when a listing is a lot or land listing, the automatic listing sync would be disabled.   
Now, this issue has been resolved. 

  
2\. We fixed an issue with active listings not being updated in Paradym.   
Previously, some active listings were not being updated due to them incorrectly showing as off market.  
Now, this issue has been resolved. We’ve updated the listing status validation process to accurately identify a listings status. 

Technology Updates  
1\. We’ve updated the Columbus Day post so it will be posted on the correct day, Monday October 24. Previously this was set to be posted on October 7. 

2\. The Paradym mobile app has been decommissioned and is no longer available for download on the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Existing users can continue using the app, however it will no longer be updated or supported.
