Step 4:  Verify the information looks correct.  Then, Delete the included "Phone" number and replace it with the Agent's primary phone number (Cell phone number works best). Lastly, please locate the area that states "Contact Info." Please make sure the phone number is replaced again with the agent's primary phone number (For Branding purposes). And, to the right.. Here if you wish to include a photo for the agent, you are welcome to add it to their account or the agent can do this on their own later: "Change Agent Photo"

Step 5: Select "Finish"   NOTE: The agent will receive an email from Paradym with their log in credentials and instructions on how to begin setting up their Paradym agent account. 

Step 6: Last Step. You will want to turn on Listing Sync for your newly added agent. To enable the Auto Tour portion for their account, you'll select the newly added agent's profile once saved, and use the "Select an Action" drop-down to select "Connect listing Sync." Next, Enter an active MLS listing number that belongs to the agent for us to sync from. You will need to choose “Select” next to the correct agent name result. (This might take a moment, please do not refresh the page.)
