# MAC RDP connection | Constellation1 Customer Hub

According to MAC announcement, the 10.7.2 update applied on December 15, 2021, introduced issues related to Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection. Please follow the steps listed below. If you are still not able to connect, please contact MAC support or your local IT.

1. Check [App Center](https://install.appcenter.ms/orgs/rdmacios-k2vy/apps/microsoft-remote-desktop-for-mac/distribution_groups/all-users-of-microsoft-remote-desktop-for-mac) link for Microsoft RDP Beta for macOS for most recent update applied after December 15, 2021
2. Apply any pending **MAC OS updates**, if available.
3. Delete the User and Gateway information from the MAC RDP App -> in the preferences section
4. Delete the current MAC RDP App
5. Download/install the latest RDP app release from [App Center](https://install.appcenter.ms/orgs/rdmacios-k2vy/apps/microsoft-remote-desktop-for-mac/distribution_groups/all-users-of-microsoft-remote-desktop-for-mac). Make sure you select update dated after December 15, 2021
6. Try to login using the RDP file we sent you; if it does not work, we suggest you create a new RDP connection manually (See instructions attached).

NOTE: In some cases, the latest RDP app may still not work, due to some other underlying MAC issue.  You may try to revert back to an older RDP build on the App Center; based on our experience Version 10.3.7 (Build 1731) from Dec 4th 2019 has been successfully working for those reporting connection issues.
