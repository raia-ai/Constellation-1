Enterprise Insights Users List  
We’ve updated the enterprise insights user list by adding a column showing each user's permission level, enabling administrators to easily see the permissions for every user.

Add Cooperating Agent To Transactions  
We have updated the Commissions tab in Transactions to allow users to add Cooperating Agents directly to transactions.   
Clicking the link opens the Add Transaction Contact window. When added, Cooperating Agents appear on the Contacts tab.   
Streamlining the workflow by eliminating the need to first attach the cooperating brokerage and then return to the transaction to add the agent.

User Permission To Access The Dashboard  
We’ve added a new permission setting to allow or restrict a user's access to view the dashboard.   
When this permission is not granted for a user type, the dashboard option will not display on the left navigation menu, preventing access to the dashboard.

User Interface Updates  
We have updated the user interface and moved some settings from the Advanced Settings to more suitable locations, improving the overall user experience by creating more intuitive and logical workflows.

*   Transaction Number has been organized into a logical visual flow: first the switch to enable it, then the prefix number, and finally the auto generated sequence number.

*   The Default Disbursed By and Default Disbursement Form settings have been removed from the Advanced settings. These settings are located in transactions on the Commissions tab. in the Additional Details section when Commission Disbursed by Third Party is enabled. 
    
    *   Note: the system will remember the previously used setting.

*   We have relocated the Transaction Import Override to the Transaction Import page. The system will retain the previously used setting.

Added New Bookmark to Seller Landlord Master Template

A new bookmark has been added to the Seller Landlord Letter master template that will insert the name of the company purchasing a property if the buyer is a business rather than an individual.   
If you have a customized letter, the bookmark can be copied from the master template and added to your custom letter.   
•    \[Buyer's Company Name\] 

MLS Agent Import

We’ve added the ability to import agents from your MLS using the Constellation1 MLS connection.   
This integration enables seamless agent data transfer from the MLS into Commissions Online.   
For more information, contact your Constellation1 representative.

REflex API

In the previous release we announced integrated with the REflex API. Now we’ve enhanced that functionality to allow the import of agents from the Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices system.  
For more information, contact your Constellation1 representative.

Agent Advance Paid by Third Party   
Recently we released functionality to account for advances to an agent from a third party. Now, we’ve updated this feature to expand the scope of third-party payments.  
 Features include,   
•    Users can attach third party advances to the agent commission details, even if the advance has not yet been disbursed by the third party.   
•    A check will be recorded in QuickBooks® to reimburse the third party’s advance, when the transaction is closed.  
•    The new functionality will not include previous Back Office Commander features such as finance charges. However, those charges can be incorporated into the value entered (e.g., enter $5,050 instead of $5,000 to include a $50 finance charge).

  
Bug Fixes

1\. We fixed an issue with the Cash Flow Projection report.  
Previously, the Cash Flow Projection report overstated projected income by erroneously accounting for a buyer concession.   
Now, we’ve fixed this issue so that the report now accurately reflects projected income.

2\. We fixed an issue with the Transaction Commission Detail report that was causing the report to error.   
Previously, the Transaction Commission Detail report was generating errors.   
Now, we resolved the underlying issue, so the report now runs successfully.

3\. We fixed an issue with links on the My Workspace not working.  
Previously, links in My Workspace to Upcoming Closings, Conditions Due, and Note Reminders were broken, preventing users from navigating to those pages.  
Now, the issue has been resolved and the links in My Workspace are now functioning properly.

4\. We fixed an issue with the Re/Max® franchise report not including agents or their portion of a transaction commission when they are not part of the primary office for the transaction.   
Previously, the Re/Max® franchise report only included commission amounts for agents assigned to the primary office of a transaction. It excluded any agents assigned to secondary offices and their share of the commission.   
Now, we have fixed this issue. The report now includes all agents and their full commission amounts, even if they are not part of the primary office.
