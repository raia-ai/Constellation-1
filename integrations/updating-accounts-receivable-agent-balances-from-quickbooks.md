If users want to update the agent's invoices on the Expenses tab of their profile, from the left navigation bar select **Agents** 

*   Select the agents name you wish to update
*   Expenses tab

Commissions Online will automatically sync the list of invoices and their statuses ie. paid vs unpaid

Note: Customized invoices will not display in the Expenses tab but balances on invoices will update and be reflected via Accounting / Agent Balance tab as noted above.

Users also have the ability to sync Accounts Receivable via the Closing Wizard.   
On the Close Transaction window, users can toggle ON/OFF the Sync Accounts Receivable Now. When toggled ON, Accounts Receivable will sync the current balance from QuickBooks®.

This option may eliminate the additional steps noted above should users want to include the most up to date information when generating the Agent Check Stub document.
