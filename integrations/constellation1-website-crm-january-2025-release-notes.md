Agent Search

We are excited to announce a new agent search feature. Users can now search for agents based on their defined service regions. 

When this functionality is enabled and configured, agent search results will display the agents service regions. Location-based agent searches will display agents located within the searched region. Service regions are defined by the service regions in the CRM. 

These service regions are visible on the agent and office search results, on the agent profile pages and, on the agent website homepage.

## BUG FIXES

**Website**

1\. Fixed an issue that prevented customer from creating an account or logging into their account using their social media X (formerly twitter).

Previously, consumers were not able to create an account or log into their account using social media login X.

Now, this issue has been resolved. Consumers’ on the websites, will be able to create an account or login to their existing account using X.

2\. Fixed an issue with the Open House header showing on a listing without the open house date and time. 

Previously, when an open house was scheduled for a listing that is more that 7 days from the current date, the open house header would display without the date and time. 

Now, this issue has now been resolved. The open house header will not show for listings that are more than 7 days from the current date as expected.

3\. Fixed an issue with agent websites not showing all their sold listings.  

Previously, on an agent website, the My Sold Listings section displayed only a portion of the agent’s sales history when a user scrolled down the page. 

Now, this issue has been resolved. 

  
4\. Fixed an issue with the photo view on the listing detail page. 

Previously, when users attempted to view all photos for a listing, the photo viewer would become malformed, preventing them from navigating through the photos. This also caused other problems with the listing detail pages.

Now, this issue has been resolved. Users can view all photos for a listing, and the photo viewer will work as expected, providing a smooth and seamless user experience.

TECHNOLOGY UPDATES 

**Website**

1\.  We've streamlined how search engine bots access and parse content related to website tokens, allowing bots to easily crawl and index this content for improved SEO.

  
2\. To optimize website crawling for high-value bots, we’ve implemented a custom rate limit. When Googlebot encounters a 429 response code, it interprets this as the server is overloaded. Increasing the rate limit will mitigate this issue and enhance the SEO value of the websites.
