If an incorrect reverse date was entered, it can be edited in Commissions Online by selecting **Edit** via the ellipsis in the **Actions** column to the far right of the Reverse entry.

_**Please note, this will only change the date in Commissions Online. If changes are required to your Accounting application, you will need to manually edit that date too.**_&#x20;
