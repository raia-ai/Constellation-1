# CRM - Zillow Integration | Constellation1 Customer Hub

**Introduction**

RED has built an integration using Zillow’s API to pull Zillow leads into rDesk CRM. This will give you the capability to route Zillow leads to the listing agent.

There are two types of configurations; agent and broker. The agent set-up is designed for individual agents that have a paid relationship with Zillow (a.k.a. Premier Agent Program). The broker set-up is for brokers that syndicate leads with Zillow (a.k.a. Zillow Pro for Brokers).

**FAQs**

How do we set this up?

The agent set-up requires the agent to configure the integration in their Zillow Agent Hub. The broker set-up is done upon request to RED, with Zillow, on the back-end and will utilize our existing lead routing options for lead assignment.

What information will RED need to request the broker configuration from Zillow?

The broker configuration requires that a maintenance request be submitted to RED. We will need,

*   Your brokerage name
*   Your brokerage address
*   A contact name and email
*   You Broker Partner Identifier
    *   Example: abcrealty-12345

Once the configuration is complete, we will notify you to test (usually takes a few days).

This information is used to identify your company with Zillow.

We are using the External Leads for pulling in Zillow leads today. How is this different?

External Leads parses or extracts the contact information from the email Zillow sends to create a contact record in CRM. This is done at the company or franchise broker level. The email also cannot be routed to the listing agent. In addition, if Zillow changes their email format, the parser will not work and requires RED to update the template used.

This integration will allow us to route to the listing agent and will not subject us to the issues that occur with format changes. We can also now offer this at the agent level. If you are using External leads for Zillow, it will be replaced with this integration and you will need to delete your Zillow definitions.

Is there a user documentation?

Yes! A user guide has been drafted and will be available that details how the agent will set up this integration in their Zillow Agent Hub and it also will include more information on the workflow for the brokers’ set-up.

When will this be available?

We are currently testing the agent configuration with one of our customers and Zillow will soon be setting up the broker configuration for the same customer so we can test that integration as well. 

We are also in the midst of finalizing our agreement as a Zillow Technology Partner. Once this is done and the testing is complete, we will be able to offer this to all interested customers immediately since this does not have to be tied to a release.

We will keep your Account Manager posted on the progress!
