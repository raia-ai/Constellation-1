# REALedger - Backup Data | Constellation1 Customer Hub

The purpose of this article is to provide steps on how to backup your REALedger data files.

It is important that you establish a regular backup routine either using backup software default in the Windows OS or via third party cloud services and recommended that you:

*   Backup REALedger daily
*   Label backups with last date and time they were written (if backups auto generated this will be the default)
*   Store one set of backup media off-site (such as Microsoft [OneDrive](http://www.onedrive.com/), Google Drive etc.)

**Versions 6.9 or below**

You will need to backup the following files:

*   **REAL\_prg.mde** (this is the program file) - typically located in C:\\REALedger folder
*   **REAL.MDW** (this is the security file) - typically located on the server or host computer
    *   The security file contains users and can be re-created if needed
*   **REAL\_DAT.MDB** (this is the data file) - typically located on the server or host computer
*   **REAL\_ARC.MDB** (this is the archive data file) - typically located on the server or host computer

**How to copy files:**

*   Right-mouse click on a file, to open the right-click menu, and choose **Copy**.
*   Browse to the location where you want to save the file, right-mouse click in a blank area and choose **Paste**

If the REALedger application is self-hosted on your company's server or workstation(s) and you experience technical difficulties, please contact your IT.
