# Accounting/Sync Closings Review | Constellation1 Customer Hub

This article provides information relating to the Accounting / Sync Closings tab.

In the event there is an error when processing a transactions closing, or if a specific user does not have access to your accounting system (selects Close Only), the transaction will be displayed via Accounting / Sync Closings. 

From the left navigation bar select **Accounting / Sync Closings**

A list of transactions will be displayed that includes the Transaction Number, Address and Post Type, the Result column will be empty.

Once any errors that generated previously have been resolved, select the transaction(s) to integrate by placing check to left of each OR select the checkbox at the top and all transactions will be selected. 

Select the Sync icon (chain link) at bottom right corner and the Result column will display **Success**

You also have the ability to select transactions and Mark as Posted by selecting the affected transaction(s) and selecting the "Mark as Posted" button. In the event that you have manually corrected the outstanding item in your accounting system, transactions marked as posted will no longer be displayed via Sync Closings and NOT integrate with your accounting system.

**Please note:** Mark as Posted functionality will NOT work for batched checks or deposits (they will display with Post Type of BATCHED).  In the event you have a batched item displayed via Sync Closings, and have manually corrected entries in your accounting system, please email us at [commissions@constellation1.com](mailto:commissions@constellation1.com) and a member of our Support Team will be happy to assist. 

We recommend users review Accounting / Sync Closings tab regularly to ensure that all transactions have completely integrated with your accounting system successfully.
