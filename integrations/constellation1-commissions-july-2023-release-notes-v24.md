## RELEASE DETAILS

New! Enterprise Insights  
We’re proud to announce the release of a brand-new feature: Enterprise Insights. This feature provides a whole new level of business intelligence for companies and franchises with multiple brokers.

Thanks to Enterprise Insights, company administrators, C-suite leaders, and finance teams now have access to a high-level view of commissions activities across their entire business. It is now easier to filter commissions data by state, region, broker, or other customized criteria and run preset or custom reports to keep a closer eye on your finances. 

New Enterprise Insights features include:

*   Management dashboard
*   Advanced data filters
*   Ability to create custom broker groups
*   Enterprise-level reports

**Dashboard**   
View high-level activity and production metrics with widgets for brokerages, agents, and transactions.

The Dashboard displays metrics for all the brokerages, agents, and transactions in Commissions. The user can click on a widget to display more details.

In the Brokerage widget, the user can select one or more brokerages to view data specific to those brokerages.

To make it easy to parse commissions data in meaningful ways, the user can view broker data by city or state or create customized Regions that group the data for the brokers in those regions together.

The user can select from along the following date ranges: Last 12, 6, 3 months or Month to Date.

The Brokerage widget displays the Record #, Brokerage Name, Street, City State, # Offices, Production, and Brokerage Net for each brokerage.

Commission Rules – Shared Non Commission Income  

We’ve updated the Shared Non Commission Income fields to accept percentages.

On the Commission Rules page, under Non Commission Income > Shared (Agent & Company), a user can now create a commission rule for non-commission income that is based on a percentage or a dollar amount.

New Commission Basis Options  
We’ve added two new options to the Commission Basis field to calculate an agent’s commission tier:  
•    Adjusted Agent Portion   
•    Adjusted Company Portion 

These options have also been added to the agent’s history.

New Transaction Record Sheet Template Names  
We’ve renamed the Transaction Record Sheet – BC template to Transaction Record Sheet – Extended.  
The Extended version is designed to meet specific reporting requirements in western Canada.  

We’ve also added a Payable(s) section to both Transaction Record Sheet templates, which shows:  
•    Payable  
•    Description   
•    Account   
•    Cheque  
•    Deposit  
•    Taxes  
•    Total

![](https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/Wiki/WikiDocs/2472652/images/KB-ReleaseNotes/Commissions/2023/07%20July%202023/2023-Commissions-July-TRS-Template1.png)

   
If a user has customized this template, this update will not affect it. 

New Transaction Record Sheet Output Format  
We’ve added PDF as an output format for exporting the Transaction Record Sheet.    
Within a transaction on the Commissions page, the user can export the Transaction Record Sheet. Now the user can choose whether to export it as a Word document or a PDF. This is helpful for users and agents who do not have a Microsoft 365 license. 

![](https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/Wiki/WikiDocs/2472652/images/KB-ReleaseNotes/Commissions/2023/07%20July%202023/2023-Commissions-July-TRS.png)

  
 Realogy Integration  
We’ve updated the Realogy logo in the franchise integrations section to the new \*Anywhere logo for consistent branding. 

![](https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/Wiki/WikiDocs/2472652/images/KB-ReleaseNotes/Commissions/2023/07%20July%202023/2023-Commissions-July-Integrations.png)

This update does not affect the integration itself. If a user is already connected to Realogy, no action needed. 

Bug Fixes

1\. We fixed an issue with canceling partial payments.   
Previously, the system allowed a user to cancel a partial payment without reversing the transaction. This caused payments that had been processed and closed to be canceled.  
Now, we have resolved this issue and will alert the user with a warning message that partial payment transactions must be reversed before they can be canceled. 

2\. We fixed an issue where the Agent Income Ledger wouldn’t correctly indicate that an agent represented both sides when the transaction included agent awards.   
Previously, when a transaction included an agent award and the agent represented both sides of the transaction, the Agent Income Ledger displayed either Buying or Selling as the side.  
Now, the Agent Income Ledger will display Both when the agent represents both sides of the transaction with an agent award. 

3\. We fixed an issue with certain mappings in the Franchise Reporting section inadvertently changing.   
Previously, in the Franchise Reporting section, the Transaction Type, Lead Source, and Favorites mappings would sometimes change, even after being saved.  
Now, we’ve fixed this issue and when the various mappings are saved, they will no longer change unexpectedly.

4\. We fixed an issue with the detail and summary versions of the Trust Reports exporting blank.   
Previously, when running the Trust Report, the exported report would be blank  
Now, we’ve fixed this issue and the detail and summary versions will have the expected report details after running them.
