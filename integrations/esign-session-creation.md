# eSign - Session Creation | Constellation1 Customer Hub

Creating a signing session through the web service can be accomplished with as little information as a token, a session title and an email address. However, most integrations upload signer information and/or documents with template information. Constellation1 eSign provides a template creation system as an enterprise feature.

The template creation system is accessible with your client administrative account and allows templates to be accessed by all users.  Integrations send those IDs when creating a session in order to pre-tag electronic signature locations on their documents.  Once a session is initialized through the web service, the user is redirected to the eSign application to configure signer roles and customize their signing session. The session documents are then sent out for electronic signatures
