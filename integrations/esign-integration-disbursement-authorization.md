# eSign Integration > Disbursement Authorization

This article details the information required to configure and use eSign Integration.

If you would like to add eSign Integration to your account for Disbursement Authorization signatures, please email [commissions@constellation1.com](mailto:commissions@constellation1.com) and a member of our Team will be happy to assist.

Before you begin, please ensure the email address attached to your Company is the best email for all eSign communication.  To do this, on the left navigation bar select **System Settings / Company**.  If you change the existing email, do not forget to save your changes.

In addition, canceled transactions are exempt from eSign Integration. 

To initiate the signing session, navigate to the Commission tab of the transaction, and select the Disbursement Authorization icon.
