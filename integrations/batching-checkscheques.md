# Batching Checks/Cheques | Constellation1 Customer Hub

This article outlines the process to batch multiple checks/cheques into a single check/cheque when integrated with your accounting solution.

The Batch Checks/Cheques card will populate with transactions that have been closed; whether processed or not.  

Batch Checks/Cheques can be accessed by selecting Accounting on the left navigation bar, then Batch Checks/Cheques tab.

Checks/Cheques can be retrieved using the filters below:

*   Check/Cheque Date: From/To
*   Payee, this drop down is mandatory in order to display all the checks/cheques for a specific Payee
*   Bank Account

Once you make your selections, select **Retrieve.** The following columns can be sorted if required: 

*   Amount
*   Memo
*   Bank Acc #
*   Issue Date
*   Posted (N=Not Posted and Y=Posted)

To batch checks/cheques:

*   Select checks/cheques to batch
*   Select **chain link** at the bottom right of the window

The individual checks/cheques will be voided and a single batched check/cheque will integrate to your accounting solution with the current date.

If a batched Check/Cheque fails, both the closed transaction and the failed batch will display via Sync Closings tab of the Accounting menu and you will receive a warning indicating the issue similar to below.

Once the errors for the transaction(s) are resolved, both the closed transaction and the batch check/cheque will integrate to your accounting solution. The individual check/cheque will void as described above.
