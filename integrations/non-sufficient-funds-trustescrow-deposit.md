# Non-Sufficient Funds Trust/Escrow Deposit | Constellation1 Customer Hub

This article highlights the steps required to record a Non-Sufficient Funds Trust/Escrow Deposit in Commissions Online.

Navigate to the Transaction / Details tab and expand the Deposits card, ensuring that the "Held by" field has your company selected.

Select Actions = NSF by clicking on the "ellipsis" to the far right of the applicable deposit that did not clear your financial institution. The View option will only display if there is a comment and/or check/cheque number entered. &#x20;

**Please note, you can only select NSF for a deposit that displays an Integration Status of Posted, or you will receive the following warning;**&#x20;

The NSF Date should be the date you received notification that the deposit did not clear your financial institution. We recommend you attach a comment, and Save.&#x20;

If the initial deposit was integrated to QuickBooks®, the NSF will automatically create a journal entry crediting the bank account and debiting the liability account, allowing an accurate bank reconciliation at month end.&#x20;

If an incorrect NSF date was entered, it can be edited in Commissions Online by selecting **Edit** via the ellipsis in the **Actions** column to the far right of the Reverse entry.

_**Please note, this will only change the date in Commissions Online. If changes are required to your Accounting application, you will need to manually edit that date too.**_&#x20;
