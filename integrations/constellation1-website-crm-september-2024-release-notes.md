## Website Release Details  

Listing Images - WebP Format  
We are upgrading listing images to the WEBP format. This is an ongoing project to improve image size without losing quality.

“WebP is a modern image format that provides superior lossless and lossy compression for images on the web. Using WebP, webmasters and web developers can create smaller, richer images that make the web faster.” Quoted from [https://developers.google.com/speed/webp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp) 

This results in faster page loads when viewing listings, allowing search engines to rank these pages higher.

This will be seamless to you and consumers on the website. When we receive listing images from the MLS, we will automatically convert the listing images formats to WEBP. 

Currently, not all MLS boards are supported, we are working to configure the conversion tool for all images we receive from the MLS.

Custom “From” Email Address  
We’ve added a fallback email address that can be used as an alternative “from” email address when sending email to customers of the website.  
The fallback email address will be used when we are not able to send email from your Custom “from” email address.

Client Email Unsubscribe   
We’ve updated a clients ability to opt-out of emails. When a client chooses to unsubscribe from saved search, saved property, or sell my home emails, they will also be automatically opted out of receiving drip marketing emails. This enhancement ensures that clients have more control over their email preferences and will only receive the communications that are most relevant to them.

##   
Bug Fixes  

**Website**

1\. Fixed an issue with featured property’s displaying the address when configured to not display the property address.   
Previously, when a property was shown as a featured property on an agent website, the property address was displayed when the listing was set to not display the property address.   
Now, this issue has been resolved. 

2\. Fixed an issue that prevented the property preview from displaying when a listing was shared on LinkedIn.  
Previously, when a listing was shared on LinkedIn, the property preview was not being displayed on the LinkedIn site.  
Now, this issue has been resolved, when sharing a listing on LinkedIn and on social media the preview will be shown. 

## Technology Updates

1\. We’re updating the source of school information displayed on the website from Attom data to Cirrus to provide a consistent and reliable source of information.
