# Batching Deposits | Constellation1 Customer Hub

This article outlines the process to batch multiple deposits into a single deposit when integrated with your accounting solution. The Batch Deposits card will populate with transactions that have been entered; whether posted or not. 

Batch Deposits can be accessed by selecting Accounting on the left navigation bar, then Batch Deposits tab.

Deposits can be retrieved using the filters below: 

*   Deposit Date: From/To
*   Bank Account

Once you make your selections, select **Retrieve.** The following columns can be sorted if required by: 

*   Bank Acc #
*   Amount
*   Deposit Date
*   Posted (N=Not Posted and Y=Posted)
*   Memo

To batch deposits:

*   Select deposits to batch
*   Select **chain link** at the bottom right of the window

The individual deposits will be voided and a single batched deposit will integrate to your accounting solution with the current date.

If a batched Deposit fails, both the affected transaction and the failed batch will display via Sync Closings tab on Trust Deposits tab of the Accounting menu and you will receive a warning similar to below indicating the issue.

Once the errors for the transaction(s) are resolved, both the transaction and the batch deposit will integrate to your accounting solution. The individual deposit will void as described above.

Should an item remain on sync closings due to a batch failure and you are confident that the transaction is properly posted in your accounting system, you will be able to "Mark as Posted" on the Sync Closings tab.  Refer to this link for further details [Accounting/Sync Closings Review](https://constellation1.na3.teamsupport.com/knowledgeBase/20849634)
