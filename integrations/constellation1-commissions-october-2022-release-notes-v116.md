New! Agent View

We’re pleased to introduce the all-new Agent View. Agent View provides a way for agents to log in to Commissions Online and view their own transactions and commissions with ease.  
Agents will need to be invited to log in. After an administrator creates an agent account in Commissions Online, they can send the agent an invitation by selecting the agent using the checkbox next to their name, clicking the Action button at the top of the page, then clicking Invite. The agent will receive an email with their login information and a link to the login page.

New! Transaction Conditions   
We’ve added the ability to add conditions to a transaction. We’ve added an Enable Conditions Tracking toggle under Advanced Settings. When enabled, a new Conditions section will appear in the Field Settings section.  
In the Field Settings section, the administrator can click the plus sign (+) to add condition labels that can then be attached to a transaction. They can also edit or delete existing condition labels.

 In the transaction, Conditions and Condition Status will also be added to the Transaction Details page, where conditions for the transaction can be added.   
The Condition Status will update automatically based on whether the condition(s) are met or not met. When all conditions have been met, this field will update to show the transaction is Firm.

Import Transaction by Status

We’ve improved the transaction import process, allowing users to import or update transactions from their transaction management system based on the transaction status. 

On the Import page, a user can enter a status in the Transaction Status field and then import or update transactions with that status. Once transactions are retrieved from their TMS, the user can select which transactions to import or update in Commissions.

**Note:** The check boxes are color-coded and indicate the following  
•    Blue – Not previously imported  
•    Orange – Previously imported   
•    Gray – Transaction with Canceled status. 

The importing of canceled listings is also included in this enhancement. If a listing status is canceled in the transaction management system, it can be imported into Commissions as a canceled listing. 

Automated Transaction Sync

We have added the ability to schedule and automate listings and transactions syncing from your Transaction Management System. 

Imports can be scheduled based on  
•    Frequency (Manual, Daily, Weekly)  
•    Time of Sync   
•    Day of Sync   
•    Transaction status 

Daily sync includes listings and transactions within the previous 24-hour period.  
Weekly Sync includes transactions and listings within the previous 7 days.  
Manual sync includes transaction and listings since the last sync date.

Canceled Transactions 

We’ve added the ability to uncancel transactions that had been set to Canceled. On the Transactions page, in the Actions menu for the canceled transaction, the user is able to uncancel the transaction by clicking Uncancel. The transaction will then display as a pending transaction.

Import Transaction from DocuSign®

We’ve added the ability to import active transactions with Under Contract status from the DocuSign® Transaction Rooms

Closed Transactions Referral Fees

We’ve added the ability for Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices franchisees to edit a referral after a transaction has closed to exempt the referral from franchise fees for franchise reporting purposes.   
On the Commission tab of a closed transaction, navigate to a referral, then click the Action menu next to the referral and select Advance Options. 

![](https://app.na3.teamsupport.com/Wiki/WikiDocs/2472652/images/KB-ReleaseNotes/Commissions/10%20Oct%202022/2022-Oct-Commission-Reffual1.jpg)  
In the Referral Advance Options modal, the user can turn on the Exempt from Franchise fee toggle to remove the referral fee from the transaction.   
After toggling on this setting for a closed transaction, the change will also reflect on the franchise report the next time it is generated.

Added Field Validation When Closing a Transaction  
We’ve added validations to the Cooperating Broker fields. If they are not populated before closing a transaction, the user will not be able to move to the next step of the closing and will receive a warning message indicating there are required fields missing.   
This allows the user to correct the issue before moving on to the next step. 

Update Agent Accounts Receivable Balance Individually or in Bulk  
We’ve added the ability to update agents’ accounts receivable balances. By navigating to the Accounting > Agent Balances tab, the user can search for and multi-select agents to retrieve and update accounts receivable balances.

Deduct Accounts Receivable from Agents’ Bill

We’ve added a new account to the General Ledger. The new account, Agent A/R Holding, is an option that allows the user to deduct accounts receivable from the agent when paying them via a bill.   
To enable this feature, add Agent A/R Holding to the General Ledger. This will enable the updates to sync with QuickBooks®.   

Add a Bank Account for Agent Deductions

We’ve added the ability to configure deductions to use a specified bank account.   
Previously, there was a restriction that did not allow a bank account for the deduction configuration  
Now, on the Deductions page for a commission, the user can select a bank account from the Receivable Account dropdown to apply deductions.

Custom Trust Reports  

We’ve added two new fields to trust reports. When creating a Trust Deposit/Disbursement Report, the user will be able to see deposits being held and whom they are being held by. 

  
The new fields are:

*   Deposit Held By   
    *   Shows entity holding deposit
*   Required Deposit Amount    
    *   Shows amount of deposit required 

The new data points can be added to custom reports. 

Emphasys / Back Office Commander Reports

We've added the following reports from Emphasys / Back Office Commander:

**Transaction Commission Detail Report**  
The Transaction Commission Detail Report displays transactions by agent and based on status, including a breakdown of commissions, deductions, and company dollar. This report is available for preview in the Summary view before running the final report. 

**Bonus Override Detail Report**

The Bonus Override Detail report displays a detailed and cumulative breakdown of bonus overrides attached to closed transactions. 

Updated From Email Address When Sending Statements  

We’ve enhanced statement delivery to use “Constellation1 Commissions” as the sender name. The From field will now show Constellation1 Commissions instead of No Reply. 

   
UI Changes

**Added Additional Information Icons**

We’ve added additional information icons to the user interface. When a user hovers their cursor over a lowercase “i” icon (ⓘ), mouseover text will appear showing more information related to the field. 

**State Dropdown Addition**  
The District of Columbia has been added to the State dropdown. 

**Commission Rules Sort Order**   
The Commission Rules dropdown now displays in alphanumeric order. This update matches the display in Back Office Commander.

Bug Fixes

  
1\. Fixed an issue with the Agent Income Summary Report showing the incorrect gross amount.   
Previously, the gross amount displayed the gross transaction commission when it should have displayed the agent side gross commission.   
Now, in the Agent Income Summary, the Gross Commission field will display the agent side gross commission. 

2\. Fixed an issue with the Franchise Details card not displaying on a transaction’s Details page.   
Previously, the Franchise Details card was not showing on the Details page of a transaction.   
Now, the Franchise Details card shows on the Details page of a transaction. 

3\. Fixed an issue with changing a transaction from percentage to dollar and the other side of the transaction not updating.   
Previously, when a user would toggle a transaction from percentage to dollar, the other side of the transaction didn’t update.  
Now, when toggling a transaction from percentage to dollar, the transaction will update on both sides. 

4\. Fixed an issue with the Knowledge Base link not working.   
Previously, when clicking the Knowledge Base link in the Profile menu, the Knowledge Base would not open.   
Now, clicking the Knowledge Base link will open the Knowledge Base.
