Import Transaction by Status

We’ve improved the transaction import process, allowing users to import or update transactions from their transaction management system based on the transaction status.&#x20;

On the Import page, a user can enter a status in the Transaction Status field and then import or update transactions with that status. Once transactions are retrieved from their TMS, the user can select which transactions to import or update in Commissions.&#x20;

**Note:** The check boxes are color-coded and indicate the following\
•    Blue – Not previously imported\
•    Orange – Previously imported \
•    Gray – Transaction with Canceled status.&#x20;

The importing of canceled listings is also included in this enhancement. If a listing status is canceled in the transaction management system, it can be imported into Commissions as a canceled listing.&#x20;

Imports can be scheduled based on\
•    Frequency (Manual, Daily, Weekly)\

Closed Transactions Referral Fees

Added Field Validation When Closing a Transaction\
We’ve added validations to the Cooperating Broker fields. If they are not populated before closing a transaction, the user will not be able to move to the next step of the closing and will receive a warning message indicating there are required fields missing. \
This allows the user to correct the issue before moving on to the next step.&#x20;

Update Agent Accounts Receivable Balance Individually or in Bulk\
We’ve added the ability to update agents’ accounts receivable balances. By navigating to the Accounting > Agent Balances tab, the user can search for and multi-select agents to retrieve and update accounts receivable balances.&#x20;

&#x20;

Deduct Accounts Receivable from Agents’ Bill

We’ve added a new account to the General Ledger. The new account, Agent A/R Holding, is an option that allows the user to deduct accounts receivable from the agent when paying them via a bill. \
To enable this feature, add Agent A/R Holding to the General Ledger. This will enable the updates to sync with QuickBooks®.&#x20;

Add a Bank Account for Agent Deductions

We’ve added the ability to configure deductions to use a specified bank account. \
Previously, there was a restriction that did not allow a bank account for the deduction configuration\
Now, on the Deductions page for a commission, the user can select a bank account from the Receivable Account dropdown to apply deductions.

Bug Fixes

1\. Fixed an issue with the Agent Income Summary Report showing the incorrect gross amount. \

3\. Fixed an issue with changing a transaction from percentage to dollar and the other side of the transaction not updating. \
Previously, when a user would toggle a transaction from percentage to dollar, the other side of the transaction didn’t update.\
Now, when toggling a transaction from percentage to dollar, the transaction will update on both sides.&#x20;

4\. Fixed an issue with the Knowledge Base link not working. \
Previously, when clicking the Knowledge Base link in the Profile menu, the Knowledge Base would not open. \
