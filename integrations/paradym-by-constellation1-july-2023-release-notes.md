# Paradym by Constellation1 July 2023 Release Notes

Production Release July 2023

**Instagram Business:** Added ability to connect to Instagram Business accounts.   
**Social Media Post Log:** Updated the label for past Instagram posts.   
**Bug Fixes**

## Release Details

Instagram Business  
We’ve added the ability to connect Paradym to Instagram Business and Instagram Creator accounts. This update increases the points of contact a broker and agent can use to reach new leads.   
Click [here](https://blog.constellation1.com/automated-instagram-posts "Automated Instagram Posts") for more details about Instagram integration with Paradym. 

Social Media Post Log  
We’ve updated previous Instagram posts to be labeled as Tours to provide a consistent label in the Social Media Post Log.  
Previously posted photos and tours will now be recategorized as Tour, so the user can easily see what has been posted to Instagram. 

Bug Fixes 

1\. We fixed an issue with agent account interfaces not displaying correctly when the account was transitioned from under a broker account to an individual agent account.  
Previously, when an agent account that was previously associated with a broker account was changed to a standalone agent account, the user interface would not display correctly.   
Now, this issue has been resolved. 

2\. We fixed an issue with Instagram using the first photo posted to a Tour and not the designated cover photo.   
Previously, when posting a photo tour to Instagram, Instagram would display the first photo uploaded to the Tour instead of the cover photo selected by the user.  
Now, this issue has been resolved. When posting photo tours to Instagram, the cover photo will be the feature image, not the first photo the user added.
