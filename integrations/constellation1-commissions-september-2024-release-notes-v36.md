## Release Details

NEW! Transaction Checklists

Commissions Online now offers a new tasks and checklists feature where company administrators can create custom tasks and checklists.

In the System Settings under Checklists, companies can create individual tasks and group them into checklists that can be attached to transactions. 

This allows transaction managers and agents to stay organized – they can receive email reminders when tasks are due and can upload and save necessary documents directly to transactions.

Transaction Record Sheet – Company Contact to eSign  
We’ve updated the Transaction Record Sheet under the Agent Commission Details, to now display the logged in user as the Company Contact when sending the Transaction Record Sheet when eSign is enabled. Previously, the Company Contact field defaulted to the first name in the dropdown menu.
