# CRM - How To Trigger A Resync For A Contact

At times, an agent may have a contact that they are unable to set up saved searches or properties for. This is because a contact must be a 'client' in CRM rDesk. A contact must be registered to become a client. If the registration button is missing, or the registration did not go through, then follow these steps to re-trigger the update which will solve the issue.

Step 1) Log into fnistools (rW)&#x20;

Step 2) In the left nav: Customer / Client > Customer List

Search for the client that is reported to have issues. Email address is typically the best way to search.

Click on the client's last name to bring up that client's details.

Step 3) Without modifying anything, scroll down the page and click on the "Update" button.

This triggers a resync to the CRM rDesk system. Upon completion, the contact will now be a client in CRM rDesk and the agent will be able to create saved searches for this contact.
