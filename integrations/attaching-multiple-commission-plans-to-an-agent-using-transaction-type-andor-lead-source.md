# Attaching Multiple Commission Plans to an Agent Using Transaction Type and/or Lead Source

This article provides the steps required to attach multiple commission plans to an Agent using the Transaction Type and/or Lead Source for automation.  For example, if all lease type transactions are split 50/50 between the Agent and Company, you will define a transaction type of Lease and once you create a lease type transaction for the Agent, it will automatically inherit the commission plan attached via the Agent's profile. 

On the left navigation bar select **System Settings / Advanced Settings / Field Settings** section to define the Transaction Type and/or Lead Source you require for reporting, integration and/or commission plan automation. 

You can change the order by selecting the Star (favorite), delete or edit the existing Transaction Type and/or Lead Source when you hover over each label. Alternatively, you can add any new ones you require. 

Once customized for your business requirements, select Save at the top of the window.

Referring to the configuration below, when a lease Transaction Type **OR** a Lead Source of Walk-In is attached to a transaction when you add the agent/team, the commission plan will automatically inherit the 50/50 commission plan vs the Default Commission Plan.

At the transaction level, if required please ensure you toggle on "Exclude from Commission Tier" if this type of transaction should NOT be counted towards the Agents Default Commission Plan.

You are welcome to override the commission plan on a transaction to transaction basis, however investing some time to configure this will be more efficient and 100% automated.
